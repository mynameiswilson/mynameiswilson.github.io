<h1>majestic RES</h1>
<p>
The Majestic RES is a rudder/elevator/spoiler-only 3-meter built-up plane with a semi-reinforced spar from <a href="http://www.laserartco.com" class="External">Laser Arts</a>.  It is a solid, strong woody plane that performs and thermals wonderfully.  I bought mine from a club-mate getting out of the hobby, and after much sanding, lightening and re-covering I managed to get it down to a decent weight.

However, as the second photo shows, I had an unfortunate &#8220;incident&#8221; with it at the <a href="http://members.aol.com/bgsoaring/2004mid-am.html" class="External">2004 BSS Mid-Ams</a>, which turned out to be a frayed (on the inside) negative battery wire.  Note to self: ALWAYS WIGGLE YOUR BATTERY WIRES BEFORE LAUNCH.
