
<h1>Allegro-Lite</h1>
<p>
The Allegro Lite is a built-up 2-meter competition model sailplane with a composite (kevlar, carbon fiber) reinforced spar designed by Dr. Mark Drela.  The finished model should weigh around 18 ounces and be capable of of a full-pedal winch launch.  
</p>

<p>
<i>UPDATE</i>: I&rsquo;ve recently (April 2005) completed my Allegro-Lite, and she ended up right under 19oz all-up-weight. She is a great flyer and I&rsquo;ve managed to hand-launch her into thermals with ease!  Awesome plane, and takes a winch launch very well! 
</p>

<p>
<i>FURTHER UPDATE</i> (August 2005): Oh no! My Allegro-Lite went down in a blaze of glory!  For some still-unknown reason, my Allegro-Lite went into the ground from about 200'-300' up.  It impacted the ground about a 1/4 mile away from me over some trees.  All pieces and parts were recovered.  A repair is expected to take some time...
