<H3>Building the AllegroLite Pod &amp; Boom Assembly  - Revised 2/5/2003</H3>
The AllegroLite fuselage is a pod and boom design.
The pod is constructed of kevlar composite with carbon fiber reinforcements.
The pod is manufactured in two halves which eventually are joined together and bonded to the boom.
The boom is a precured carbon fiber and fiberglass composite tapered tube which has unidirectional and bias plies.
This page covers the assembly of the pod and boom into the fuselage.
Mounting of the electronics and routing of pushrods is integral to the assembly of the fuselage and is therefore covered on this page.
It is assumed that you have a pair of pod halves, a boom, pushrods and housings, your servos, and miscellaneous wood materials.

Bud also offers high quality pod halves for sale; contact him for details.
Contact <A HREF="mailto:psloan@yahoo.com">Patrick Sloan</A> for details on purchasing a high quality commercially produced boom which meets the Allegro Lite specification.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="red" SIZE=+1>WARNING:</FONT> As it turns out, Bud has been using the Allegro Composite 2M fuselage plan (<A HREF="http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/allegro2m/fuse_allegro.pdf">Allegro Fuselage Plan</A>) instead of the Allegro Lite plan.
The building sequence on this page shows the following details which are different than the Allegro Lite plans:
<UL>
<LI>The bulkheads are in slightly different locations.
<LI>The wing bolt locations are therefore also different.
<LI>A third wedge shaped bulkhead is used to reinforce the boom mounting.
<LI>The spoiler servo is mounted inside the fuselage.
<LI>The servos are farther aft.
<LI>The pod cutouts are different.
<LI>The ballast compartment floor/hook-beam details are slightly different.
</UL>
You will need to adjust your steps accordingly if you use the Allegro Lite plans.
If you followed other sequences on these building pages, then in particular, the wing bolt locations are definitely different!
If you have already drilled the wing bolt beam holes, then it is recommended that you use the wing itself to properly align the bulkhead locations.

<LI><IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Pod_Boom_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Using the full size plan, mark the wing bolt holes and cutouts.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Pod_Boom_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Make the required cutouts.
Several methods can be used to cut the cutouts.
An X-acto #11 blade can be used.
Bud prefers a diamond coated disk in a Dremel following with a 1/2 inch drum sander.
Cutting the holes will leave a fuzzy edge.
Using CA will make it easier to sand the fuz away.
<P>
Note: Bud's holes, cutouts, and bulkhead locations are based on the Allegro Composite plans.

<LI><IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Pod_Boom_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Cut 2 slabs of medium balsa measuring 3/16 x 1 x 11-1/2 inches.
Carve and sand these to fit into each pod half.
Fit them as close to parallel to the center line as possible.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Pod_Boom_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Sand the pod where balsa makes contact to scuff the surface.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Pod_Boom_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Mix a small batch of epoxy and thicken with Cabosil or micro balloons.
Coat the balsa with a medium coat of epoxy and place into each pod half.
The thickened mix will fill any irregularities between the pod and balsa sides.
<P>
Note:  The Allegro-Lite fuse drawing shows rails of 1/4 x 3/4 inch basswood 
rather than balsa, and the rails don't extend behind the front bulkhead.
Either approach works fine.  If you go with basswood, Mark suggests 
that 1/4 x 1/2 inch rails be used instead.  This smaller size is adequate
and is easier to shape.

Draw a center line on the bottom of the piece and use this to check for proper fit with each pod half as you go.
<P>
Note: The Allegro-Lite fuse uses a 1/2 inch wide maple rail instead of the floor.
Mark says a basswood rail is also sufficient if 0.021 inch carbon is used on top.
The basswood is easier to shape than the maple.

Either hard balsa or bass can be used for the cores and faced with 1/32 inch plywood.
Glue or epoxy can be used for this step.
<p>
Note: Mark's original plans specify 3/16 hard balsa with grain oriented horizontally, faced with 1/64 inch ply.
Mark also specifies fiberglass patches on either side to capture the nuts on the Allegro-Lite plans.

Note: The notches on the upper corners of the bulkheads are for routing the pushrod housings later.

The bulkheads depicted here and in remaining steps are based on the Allegro Composite plan.

Bud prefers to use the diamond cut off blade in a Dremel tool, but an X-acto knife or even a razor saw can be used to cut the end of the pod off.
<P>
Note: Depending on where you got your pod halves, this trimming operation might be slightly different.
For example, Mike Bailey's pod halves have a significant "tubular" portion instead of the blunt end like Bud's pod halves.

Note: It just happens that a 1/2 inch Dremel drum sander is the near perfect size for this operation.  Bud points out that the 1/2 inch drum sander is indispensable for many model building uses.

<IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Pod_Boom_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Bud likes to flare out the hole on the forward side of the bulkhead using the drum sander to provide for a fillet of epoxy when the boom is later bonded in place.
<P>
Note: These steps are based on the Allegro Composite plan which utilizes a third bulkhead.
If you are using the Allegro Lite plan, the aft bulkhead supports the boom.
In this case, the boom must be notched to permit the wing bolt to pass through.
A round basswood bulkhead is made to fit <B>inside</B> the boom, and holds the rear bolt nut.
First drill the center of the bulkhead for 10-32 clearance of the wing bolt and harden the hole with thin CA.
Also drill the 3/32 inch hole to pass the antenna.
Next, cut the nut platform into the bulkhead, and glue the nut to it with CA.
Then pot the assembly into the end of the boom, which is already notched for the bolt.
Use enough epoxy around the nut to trap it firmly.
Later, when gluing the boom into the pod, put a bolt in the bolt hole to make sure the bolt is vertical.

The hub sholder can be made by turning the dowel in an electric drill, drill press, or lathe.
A small screw and washer retains the crank on the hub.
The bell crank assembly is bonded to the inside of the pod in a few steps.

Note: Bud points out that this configuration is different from Mark's original plans but worked better for him.
This bell crank is required when the spoiler servo is mounted inside the fuselage.
If the servo is mounted in the wing as specified in the Allegro Lite plans, then the fabrication and installation of this bell crank should be omitted.
