<H3>Building the Joiners - Revised 4/18/2002</H3>
The wing joiner rod assemblies must be fabricated before the mid panels can be built.
It is possible to forgo fabrication of the joiner tube assemblies until the center panel building sequence,
but you might as well make both joiner rod and tube assemblies at the same time.
For Mark Drela's original figures and joiner building details, see the following links:

<LI><IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Joiner_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Working on a flat non-stick surface (like wax paper on a sheet of plate glass),
assemble each set of three laser-cut 1/8 inch ply wedge pieces into 3/8 inch wide wedges with 5-minute epoxy or medium CA.
The central piece in each wedge stack is somewhat smaller than the other two.
When stacked together, this results in a sort of groove in the center of the wedge which
cradles either the joiner rod or tube as needed.  Bond strength is not critical here.
Remove excess adhesive from the wedge faces to get good subsequent bonds to the 
rod, tube, or sparcap.
<P>
Note in the figures below:  the joiner rod assembly is shown up side down for clarity.  The joiner tube assembly is shown with the 1/8 inch extra side plies already tapered.  In fact this tapering is done after the tube assembly is completed, before the tube assemblies are installed during the center panel build sequence.  While building the tube assemblies, these side plies are left full thickness.

<P>
Notes: Try to line up the ends of the wedges at the dihedral brake along planes that are slanted back 6 degrees from square.  This will ensure that the rod and tube assemblies will slide together leaving no gap (see photo and notes in the last step below).
<P>
Use a good slow epoxy for this step.
Use cabosil to thicken the epoxy to vaseline consistency so that the pieces will stay put.
If you're good at jigging up lots of separate pieces together, proceed immediately with the next step.
Otherwise wait until the epoxy sets up to a rubbery state and then remove the splooge before proceeding.

a full height continuous piece.  For the tube assemblies, you will probably need to cut the 1/64 inch ply
into wedges to accommodate the larger diameter of the tube.
<P>
<IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Joiner_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Then add the provided laser-cut 1/8 inch full-height side plates to the 
tube assembly.  When done, the tube assembly will be 5/8 inches wide,

Note: You can skip this step by incorporating the glass into the
bondline when gluing the rod unit onto the bottom sparcap when you build
the mid panels (discussed in step 7 below).
Pre-gluing it as shown here is one more step, but it does make it 
slightly easier to align the rod unit over the bottom sparcap.

<LI><IMG SRC="AllegroLite_Joiner_Building/checkbox.jpg"> Trim the rod and tube assemblies to the
exact correct length. 
The trimmed units are shown in the first photo below.
You can bevel the tube assembly to minimize the joiner gap
shown in the second photo.  The gap can also be minimized 
by being very careful during the step in which the wedges 
are glued to the rods and tubes such that their mating surfaces 
(those at the dihedral break) end up with a 6 degree face.
This gap is not critical in any case.  If either unit ends
up slightly too short, just extend it with a piece of medium
or hard vertical-grain balsa on the end.

<P>
In these photos the 1/8 inch side plies on the tube assemblies 
are still not beveled, which must be done before the center panel assembly.
The beveling is done such that the assembly comes out with a
1/2 inch width and the tube ends up with a sweep which matches 
the rod sweep (see Mark's original documents for more details,
<A HREF="http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/allegrolite2m/joiners.pdf">Joiner Plan</A> and <A HREF="http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/allegrolite2m/wing_plan.pdf">Wing Plan</A>).
The beveling lines are best determined by sliding the tube assembly 
onto the completed mid panel and aligning the mid panel with the
center panel plan. A belt or disk sander is ideal for beveling the ply.
It's OK to leave the assembly a little wider than 1/2 inches, so its
sides will be bulged slightly after cleanup 
(see <A HREF="http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/allegrolite2m/wing_build.pdf">Wing Building Sequence</A> for more details).
<P>
Before assembling the mid panels,
glue the joiner rod units down onto the bottom sparcap in the
correct position over the plans.
This can be combined with step 6 above.
Clean off the excess epoxy when still rubbery.
You can then proceed with the mid panel assembly and not
worry about the rod unit shifting accidentally.
Cover the exposed joiner rod with masking tape during assembly
to protect it from stray epoxy.
<P>
Before assembling the center panel,
glue the tube units down onto the ends of the bottom center sparcap.
Work over the plans, and use the completed mid/tip panels as jigs
to precisely position the tube unit on the bottom sparcap with the
correct sweep.  Clean off the excess epoxy when still rubbery.
If you have the center bolt beam built,
you can then proceed with the center panel assembly.
<P>

<P>
This completes the joiner building sequence.  Continue building the mid panels at this point.  These built joiner assemblies will be glued into mid and center panels as they are built.
