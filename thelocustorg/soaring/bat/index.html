Oh, <a href="http://californiasailplanes.com/planes/epp/bat.htm" class="External">The Bat</a>!  What can't be said about the Bat that hasn't been already said about a brick with wings?  Well, I guess I could say a little -- this thing ROCKS!  Our man Gordy got a bunch of us in the club together and bought about a dozen Bats from <a href="http://www.windrider.com.hk" class="External">WindRider</a> in Hong Kong (this was before <a href="http://www.californiasailplanes.com" class="External">California Sailplanes</a> was importing them) and we built them for the Frankfort slope.  I think mine ended up weighing nearly <i>two pounds</i> all-up weight.  Most of that weight sits in the very "beak" of the beast.  
</p>

<p>
Despite the high weight of the thing it flies like it is on rails and retains a lot of energy!  Now, while you probably shouldn&rsquo;t combat with the Bat, as it tends to not recover very fast from &#8220;hits&#8221;, you <i>can</i> do dynamic soaring (aka DS, DS'ing) with it, and since it is made of EPP it is a great trainer for DS.
</p>

<p>
The kit itself costs $50 + $10 shipping from <a href="http://www.californiasailplanes.com" class="External">California Sailplanes</a>, and it is very well made.  There are preformed holes for servos, battery and receiver and a full-length spar.  Ming from WingRider even throws in all the packing tape, strapping tape, and even some little plastic whistles to embed in the wing.
