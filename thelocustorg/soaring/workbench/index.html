Needing a large, flat, and clean place to build my <a href="../allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a>, and having a couple of leftover doors in my basement, I set about to build a pair of workbenches.  I looked for some free plans on <a href="http://www.google.com" class="External">Google</a> and quickly came up with <a href="http://www.hammerzone.com/archives/workshop/bench/below20.html" class="External">Building a Basic Work Bench</a>.  It&rsquo;s a little smaller than what I wanted, and I already had a perfectly good workbench-top, a door (80" x 30") that we had removed from its hinges upstairs!  80" x 30" = 2400" square inches of pure workbench.  So, with a rough plan in mind, we headed to Home Depot.

I already had one 2" x 4" at home, so we got 5 of the straightest 2x4.s we could find, and box of 3" deck screws.  I returned home and made a quick plan (as you can see in the image above).  It only took about 2 hours to complete, so I was happy with my spur-of-the-moment build.  Now I have a nice, flat place to build the next sailplane I will crash!  Some photos were taken and my rough plan was made with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The Gimp</a>, and you can see them in the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/soaring/20040830workbench">workbench gallery</a>.
