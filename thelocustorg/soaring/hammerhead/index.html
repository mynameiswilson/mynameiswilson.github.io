
<h1>Hammerhead</h1>
<p>
The Hammerhead is a one-design slope racer from <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Polecat Aeroplane Works</a> that conforms to the <a href="http://www.slopeflyer.com/artman/publish/article_162.shtml" class="External">Midwest Slope Challenge's One-Design Rules</a>. It has glass underneath the wood sheeting on the wings and features a glass fuselage with carbon fiber reinforcements and a slip-on nosecone.  It also sports a handy removable tail.  The wing is also forward-swept by about 2 inches.  
</p>

<p>
It balances 2.125" from the leading edge at the center, and mine ended up weighing right at 26oz, which is good considering that the minimum weight for a one-design ship is 25 ounces.  I used a very heavy Sullivan "Goldenrod" push-cable for the elevator.  Had I used music wire or a carbon fiber rod, I could have hit 25 oz on the nose.  A ballast system is planned for this bad boy.
