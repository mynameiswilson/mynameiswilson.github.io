Woe unto the pilot who carries his planes about in an unboxed manner!  Needing a box to carry my DLGs in to an out-of-state contest in the back of a pickup truck, I quickly hashed out the plans to make one out of a single sheet of coroplast. This design allows for a 60" wing (or a 60" wing segment) and comfortably and safely holds 3 fuselages, 3 wings and I even managed to get the wing for my 2-meter <a href="../allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a> in there as well!

I procured the sheet of corogated plastic (coroplast) from my local <a href="http://fastsigns.com" class="External">Fast Signs</a> shop for $40.  Using a yard stick, a utility knife and some gaffers tape, I whipped out a box in under an hour.  Wal-Mart sells (on occassion) a 1' cube of dense foam for about $11, and using a long knife I cut it into four (4) 2" slices and one (1) 4" slice.  Clasps were made using some utility/backpacker rope and two large buttons.  A handle was fashioned out of some of the scrap coroplast and taped to the lid.  However, I found that the adhesive in gaffers tape, while marvelous, does not stand up to midday sun very well.  Instead, I used some nylon bolts and nuts (handy for when I forget my wingbolts).
