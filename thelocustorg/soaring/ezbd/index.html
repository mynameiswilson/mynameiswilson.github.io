<p>
Dr. Mark Drela&rsquo;s original <a href="http://charlesriverrc.org/articles/bubbledancer/markdrela-bubbledancer-3m.htm" class="External">Bubble Dancer</a> is a super-lightweight, super-strong RES sailplane made from wood and composite (carbon, fiberglass, kevlar) materials.  Released to the web in 2002, it has spawned a number of ARF imitators (the AVA, the Danny, the Topaz), but had never been released as a full do-it-yourself kit.  That is until Denny Maize at <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Polecat Aeroplane Works</a> designed (in part with Dr. Drela) the <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/ezbd" class="External">EZ Bubble Dancer (EZBD)</a>.  Having built an <a href="../allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a> and having <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/allegrobuild">fully documented that build</a>, Denny tapped me to build EZBD #1, and write the build documentation.</p>

<p>
Over the span of a few months, Denny shipped me the parts (CNC milled in his shop) and I put it all together! Heavier than the original, but still up to the rigors of a full-pedal winch launch, the EZBD is what a lot of the Drela-Design faithful have been waiting for.

I first flew mine in April of 2006, and it is now my favorite plane.  Flying at the 2006 NATS in the RES competition, I put up 4 of the best rounds of my life, getting my time and often winning my flight group while working in some tough conditions.
