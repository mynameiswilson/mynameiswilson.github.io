<h1>Citation</h1>
<p>
The Citation was a short-lived club plane manufactured in the mid-to-late 1990s by the <a href="http://members.aol.com/bgsoaring/" class="External">Bluegrass Soaring Society</a>.  It has an SD7080 airfoil and in speaking with the designers, it is essentially a Super V with a few modifications.  Coming in far heavier than anything I had previously flown (~75oz), its amazing how well this bird can float! My first flight with it got me a 12 minute flight, thus endearing it to me immediately.</p>

<p>
The wing is bagged fiberglass over "grey foam" with an endgrain balsa spar.  The fuselage is also all completely fiberglass with what appears to be a gelcoat of some sort.  This plane has absolutely no carbon fiber that I can tell.  It uses two steel wing rods for the tips.

Much thanks goes out to Gordy Stahl, who has entrusted this plane to me on a permanent-loan basis.  It was his primary ship for a number of years, and has been hauled out of retirment to give me something to fly after my <a href="../allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a> met an unfortunate end.
