<p>
So, I&rsquo;ve been flying RC planes for about 3 years now, and last year I really got hot and heavy into sailplanes.  Most of what I had flown before were small handlaunch and wing-type-things, but then I finally got a &#8220;standard&#8221; sized 2-meter sailplane.  I soon found out that doing work on one of these things at the field is a major pain in the butt -- unless you have a stand of some sort. On a couple of occassions, I was lent the use of a <a href="http://www.super-stand.com" class="External">Super-Stand</a> (or maybe it was a <a href="http://www.adesigner.com/hobbies/betterstand.htm" class="External">Better Stand</a>?).  A great little tool, but the cost of either of those is $70-$90! So, I got to thinking... "How can I make a sailplane field stand without spending more on the stand than I did on my airframe?"

<p>
After doing a bit of research &lsquo;round the web (but mostly at <a href="http://www.liftzone.com" class="External">LiftZone</a>&rsquo;s forums), I found a couple of cheap DIY field stands (most notably <a href="http://isoar.ca/~andrewm/bkmks/RC/Field_Stands/" class="External">this one</a>), but they were still lacking the features of the <a href="http://www.super-stand.com" class="External">Super-Stand</a> (like being collapsible, adjustable, and the ability to weather-vane). What to do?
</p>

<div class="Center">
<a href="images/ben-idea.jpg" class="Enlargement"><img src="images/ben-idea-small.jpg" title="inspirado strikes!" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>
Inspiration struck, and I quickly sketched out my plan on a piece of notebook paper.  In my mind, I made up a list of features I&rsquo;d want in this stand.
</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Features</h2>

<ul class="Bullets">
<li>Cheap</li>
<li>Made from readily available PVC bits</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Water&ndash; &amp; Weather&ndash;proof</li>
<li>Adjustable wing supports (for testing flaps, etc.)</li>
<li>Adjustable nose and tail supports</li>
<li>Collapsible and portable</li>
<li>Use at the field with a stake, tripod, or on the workbench</li>
<li>Should be able to weathervane on the stake</li>
</ul>


<p>So, with $10 in my pocket, I headed down to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com" class="External">Home Depot</a> and picked up what I thought I needed.
</p>

<a name="ingredients"></a>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class="Bullets">
<li>1 10&apos; piece of 1/2&quot; PVC pipe</li>
<li>8 90&deg; 1/2&quot; elbows </li>
<li>4 45&deg; 1/2&quot; elbows </li>
<li>7 1/2&quot; tees</li>
<li>2 1/2&quot; crosses</li>
<li>4 1/2&quot; caps</li>
<li>1 hacksaw or something similar</li>
</ul>

<p>
All told, it was well under $10 for all of the supplies -- the biggest challenge was getting the 10&apos; PVC pipe in my car!  Luckily, my Nissan Maxima has a handy "ski-hole" in the rear armrest, and it fits perfectly from the rear of my trunk to the front of my dash.
</p>

<a name="preprod"></a>
<h2>Pre-production</h2>
<p>
From your 10&apos; section of 1/2&quot; PVC...
</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut 4 1 1/2&quot; pieces</li>
<li>Cut 4 3&quot; pieces</li>
<li>Cut 12 4&quot; pieces</li>
<li>Cut 2 5&quot; pieces</li>
<li>Cut 4 6&quot; pieces</li>
<li>Cut 2 9&quot; pieces</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that this is 118&quot; exactly, so don&rsquo;t go over too much on your cuts!
</p>

<a name="construction"></a>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<h3>Base</h3>
<p>
First off, let&rsquo;s build the base of the thing.  This uses the 1 1/2&quot;, 4&quot; and 5&quot; pieces, all 7 of the tees and 4 of the 90&deg; elbow pieces.
</p>

<div class="Center">

</div>

<p>
Connect 4 of the 4&quot; pieces together with 3 of the tees to make one side, and then repeat for the other side.
</p>

<p>
Connect the two sides together by putting one of the 5&quot; pieces into the center tee of each side, and connect those two 5&quot; pieces (now connected to the sides) with another tee.
</p>

<p>
On the ends of each side, connect a 90&deg; elbow.  Into each elbow, insert 1 of our 4 1 1/2&quot; pieces.  Then take one of our 45&deg; pieces and put that onto the exposed end of the 1 1/2&quot; pieces.  This should completely (or almost completely) hide the 1 1/2&quot; piece from our sight. 
</p>

<p>
You should now have something approximating the image above.
</p>


<h3>Sides</h3>
<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s make the side pieces.  These are simple!  Just take 1 of our 9&quot; pieces, and put two 90&deg; elbows on either side.  In the vacant holes of each elbow, fit 1 of the 6&quot; pieces.  Then fit the 2 6&quot; pieces into their corresponding empty tees in either side.

<p>
Finally, we&rsquo;ll be making the front and rear &#8220;nose and tail holder&#8221; pieces. Find our 2 crosses, and put 2 3&quot; pieces in one half of the &#8220;X&#8221;, and put 2 4&quot; pieces in the other half of the "X".  On top of the 3&quot; pieces, put 1 1/2&quot; cap.  Fit the 4&quot; pieces into the 45&deg; elbows at either end.

<a name="stake"></a>
<h2>Making the Stake</h2>
<p>
I haven&rsquo;t quite figured this one out yet, but I&rsquo;ll probably get another piece of PVC pipe (1&quot; or bigger) and a cross, and make a cruciform stake I can step into the ground.  The other alternative is to use a small hex nut so I can mount this thing on my camera tripod.  More on this later!
</p>

<a name="finishing"></a>
<h2>Finishing Up</h2>

<p>
Make sure to tap everything together to ensure a tight fit, and make sure it&rsquo;s all square.  I just put the stand on the floor of my basement and tapped lightly with a hammer.  I rubber mallet might be a better choice, but mine was outside, and it was <i>really</i> cold.
</p>

<p>
You may want to use some PVC glue to secure some of the non-adjustable pieces together.  This will probably help in the long-run, and keep you from having to re-tap it together all the time.
</p>

<p>
To make the adjustable parts easier to move, but to still keep them in place, try sanding the ends of the pieces on which the movement occurs.  It shouldn&rsquo;t take a whole lot to loosen it, and you don&rsquo;t want to over-do it.
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s about it!  I&rsquo;ve successfully made a mountain out of a mole-hill, I think!  It&rsquo;s really quite simple, but I thought for sake of completeness, I&rsquo;d fully document this little project.
