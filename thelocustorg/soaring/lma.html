After seeing how expensive most lost model alarms were, and how <i>in</i>expensive PIC microchip programmers were, I set off to find the plans for a do-it-yourself (DIY) microprocessor-controlled lost model alarm.  After a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">googling</a> and trolling the <a href="http://www.rcgroups.com" target="_blank">RCGroups</a> forums, I found <a href="http://www.designsoft.com.au/ahome/rc/PIC-LMA/LMA.html">this 12F675 controlled LMA project</a>.
</p>


<p>
I procured an Olimex <a href="http://www.olimex.com/dev/pic-pg2c.html">PIC-PG2</a> serial PIC programmer from  <a href="http://www.phanderson.com/ordering_1.html">phanderson.com</a> via <a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">eBay</a> for the whopping sum of $13, and some 12F675 chips (and other assorted bits and pieces) from <a href="http://www.mouser.com" target="_blank">Mouser</a>.  I had some servo-extensions laying around, and they would complete the package.  The design is very flexible, and performs a number of other functions, such as glitch-counting, low-voltage alarm, and a &#8220;beep on demand&#8221; function.  You can set the low-voltage setting in the code before you burn the chip, and you can build it for either horns or piezo buzzers.  This was my first experience building a microchip controlled anything, so I am fairly happy!  All told, I think the whole thing weighs well under 1/2 oz, depending on configuration.</p>


<p>
I haven't had a chance to work on these any further, as I've been working on my <a href="allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a> for most of the winter, but I intend on hashing a few out for local club-mates.
