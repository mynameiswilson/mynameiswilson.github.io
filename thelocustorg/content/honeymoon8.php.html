day 8 - saturday, may 4 2002
hays, KS to st. louis, MO

After visiting the Hays, KS Wal-Mart (perdon -- it was the SUPER WalMart
FoodCenter), we headed back on I70 towards Topeka, Kansas City, and St.
Louis.  

I had looked up Kansas on http://www.roadsideamerica.com, and found that
two stops on our route, Salina and Junction City both had some sites in
them.  I slept through the Salina attraction -- which is the "Bones of
Seymour" -- an elephant that went on a rampage from circus in 1920, and
was killed after being shot with 15 doses of poison and 15 steel-tipped
bullets.  Oh well.  Junction City had an "Atomic Cannon" -- which was a
short-lived weapon made by the gubment during the cold war -- it could lob
a tactical atomic weapon 7 miles.  The prototype was only fired once,
thankfully.  However, in my infinite wisdom, I didn't get detailed
directions to the site of the Atomic Cannon, and we couldn't find it.
However, there was yet another Air Force Base, which Kelly and I didn't
really want to go on -- i think the atomic cannon lay behind its walls.
At least i was within a couple of miles of an Atomic Cannon.  

On through Topeka and Kansas City.  Outside of Kansas City, we stopped
into a Chinese buffet.  It sucked.  Bad.  Louisville is blessed quality
ethnic restaurants.  We also have our share of crappy ones, sure, but they
are outweighed by the good ones, at least.

Back on the road, between Kansas City and St. Louis, we were travelling
about 80 MPH when we were all of the sudden passed on the left (in the
emergency lane) by some nutball.  He continued on down the road, braking
erradically and swerving and what-not.  He seemed to be a little
intoxicated -- okay, he was sloshed.  I called 911, reported it, and they
said that they would do something about him.  About 15 miles past that, we
saw him on the the side of the road -- RELIEVING HIMSELF, IN FULL VIEW OF
THE PASSING TRAFFIC.  Hilarity.  We stopped for gas and to relieve
ourselves (i told kelly that apparently it's OK to do it on the side of
the road, but she objected), and headed on -- wondering what happened to
our guy.  Another 15 miles down the road, we see him again -- sitting in
the back of a police cruiser.  Hah!  Dumbass.

We tried to stay at the same Comfort Inn we stayed at during our last stay
in St. Louis, but they were all booked up -- so we are staying in a Days
Inn with a pool and game room and all.  Lots of kids here, and a little
more expensive than the Comfort Inn, but oh well -- we are shaving a
couple of days off our trip already.

We checked in, swam, and then headed towards Nacho Mama's -- the
restaurant we tried to eat at last Sunday, but they were closed.  They
were open today, though!  It's a cool little fast-food tex-mex joint.
Kelly had some tasty Portobello Quesadillas, and i had their taco platter.
The salsa was roasted and sublime!  The nachos and guacamole tasty as
well...  Down the road was "Hacienda" and they were throwing a HUGE Cinco
De Mayo celebration.  Lots of drunken thirtysomethings there.  

We are going to a St. Louis Cardinals game tomorrow, and then off to home.
Yay!  I love baseball, and this is only my second MLB game.  We ordered
tickets in 10 minutes, too.  Yay Internet!  

We have a good internet connection this time, so i've uploaded pics from
Tuesday and Wednesday (albuquerque and tusayan, AZ).  

All of this travelling has been quite fun so far.  But it's starting to
blend together, because we have done SO much and travelled so far.  It's
like Ozzy Osborne on tour -- i have to have the name of the city i'm in
written on my hand!  No, not really, but close enough.

Tomorrow -- World Market (that cool Pier-One-Done-Right store, the
baseball game, Olney Albino Squirrel Hunt #2, and then home!)
