positively over the next two months to the world.&nbsp; [May 8, 2007, 357pm]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I hope that this isn’t too weird to <span class="SpellE">blog</span>:

<p class="MsoNormal">I hope that this isn’t too weird to <span class="SpellE">blog</span>
either: In a very similar fashion to the 1136am post, I am not interested in
introductions towards that kind of relationship through those same people
mentioned in that post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think there is
an obvious sense in which I mean that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>[May 12, 2007, 532pm]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, it appears that I had dropped a hand-written
sheet that was preparation for today’s <span class="SpellE">blog</span>
post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can only do my best to reproduce

<p class="MsoNormal">The text in this post may seem quite nutty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To a large extent, the text itself is what is
most important, as some high-ranking foreign officials may have evilly placed
malicious meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please feel free to
ignore this post if it doesn’t make sense: It should be clear that these are
not necessarily real-time observations as I type text in this <span class="SpellE">blog</span> post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
reminder, there are no <span class="GramE">triple-tilde’s</span> in this <span class="SpellE">blog</span> post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should
be clear that nothing in this post serves as a directive of any kind; this
keeps with conventions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps my moral
weight has been compromised; however, I will adjust and proceed with control of
a particular network as before; perhaps good will come of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, public audiences in different
countries (particularly <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>)
receive different versions and narrations of <span class="SpellE">RCC’s</span>
activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, reading
audiences of this <span class="SpellE">blog</span> post in other languages may
not receive an accurate translation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that certain high-ranking governmental and military officers (such as
generals) in <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
take particular pride in displaying the suffering of others; again, their honor
may be in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a sense of
an honorable decline, an honorable statement in deed of the word no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an honorable decline or honorable
statement in deed might be the moral choice for any person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be apparent that almost all of
outgoing directives via physical movements of my body (to a particular network)
have been faked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that certain
kinds of technology permit the induced blearing of eyes as one might expect
when a person is observed to have been intoxicated by alcohol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a notion of serial fake <u>M</u>.<u>P</u>._.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a sense of stasis that I would like
to address; it involves a conservation of my mental capacities, verbal
capacities, technical capacities, certain kinds of normal movement capacities,
and various brain capacities; as many people observe, the world is a very
different place than what it was a year ago, in terms of technology that give
insight into a person’s thoughts, transmission of such thoughts, and receipt of
such thoughts by other persons; the same thought-related technology has come to
reach a very high level of capability that can be loosely associated with a
one-word computing term of <span class="SpellE">prefetch</span>; this same
thought-related technology had until somewhat recently been associated with
idea that persons will always be considered as transmitters; such transmitters
of thoughts might be considered as verifiably alive as long as they keep
transmitting at a certain level of quality or frequency; this sense of <span class="SpellE">prefetch</span> can also be associated with new technology that
can overrun what was being <span class="SpellE">prefetched</span> naturally in a
person; this overrunning could be used to produce the apparent effect of a
person without a high level of her own thought control; this sense of <span class="SpellE">prefetch</span> can also be used to prompt phrases in words and
thoughts themselves, as in brainstorming (a creative writing technique); regarding
this thought-related technology, it is possible to anticipate what a person
might be getting ready to think about and to <span class="SpellE">prefetch</span>
their mental speech to change what actually comes out as mental speech
perceived by others; in certain cases, a level of mental access permits
individuals to a more intuitive non-verbal level of communication that was
previously only available at a verbal level; this level of mental access may
allow a person to pretend that a transmitter has no original thinking by using
this anticipation to form mental speech of the person’s own; there has been a
notion that this same thought-related technology can be related to muscular
control, including that of <span class="SpellE"><i style="">os</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">oscularis</span></i>
(this Latin term may be incorrect); such thought-related technology related to
muscular control has been used to change facial affect and facial expressions;
I’ve started to place myself into such a kind of stasis along with holding
potential capabilities in reserve; ideally, this Friday (May 18), I will begin
to exit this stasis as I will finally receive pay from my work since January 1
of this year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are times when I do
not attempt to counter apparently harmless changes to my thoughts and body
movements; perhaps it is best for me to conserve my capabilities to counter
such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a sense of holding
potential in reserve that I should discuss to some small extent, at least with
a few phrases: muscle recruitment, physical capabilities, concentration
capabilities, specific mental capabilities, specific will capabilities,
specific will-riding capabilities (including a certain kind of persistence),
specific meditation capabilities, and specific
countering-against-certain-kind-of-<span class="SpellE">prefetch</span>
capabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a notion of the
four-word phrase of riding out the storm; such may be applied to affect,
apparent mood, and apparent will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
positive will to live, no true <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">h.i</span></span>.,
no true <span class="SpellE">s.i</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here are a few phrases: higher aims; non-consideration of others for the
greater and individual good; utilitarian metric with the same fixed floor to
the positive value of any particular person; fixed costs, sunk costs,
incremental costs, and moral return; personal gain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[May 15, 2007, 949pm]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The text in this post may seem quite nutty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, it’s good to make sure to
recognize that nothing in this <span class="SpellE">blog</span> page is to be
considered as a directive, in any fashion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Second of all, it is important to note that ‘I’ specifically refers to
Rolando ‘Chip’ Cheng, Jr., and that ‘my’ is specifically associated with
Rolando ‘Chip’ Cheng, Jr. as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third
of all, it is may be important to mention the notion of fake <u>M</u>.<u>P</u>.<u>_</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a highly undesirable facial affect
that appeared today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fourth of all, I am
aware of the possibility that there have been attempts to corrupt my <span class="SpellE">blog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifth of all,
I came to <span class="SpellE">blog</span> tonight because of potential damage to
my physical transmission capabilities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This involves damage to left-side <span class="SpellE">innervation</span>
to my vocal cords as well as other <span class="SpellE">innervation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without this capability, it is harder to
receive my transmissions without being easily detected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This potential damage to my physical
transmission capabilities seems to have come about most strongly tonight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that this was important to share
despite how quite nutty it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[June 7,
