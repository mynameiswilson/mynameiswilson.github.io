so, apparently, more than a year ago I made some tweaks to IMS -- the 0.02 release.  Well, you can go and download it <a href="ims/download.php.html">on the downloads page</a>.  I can&rsquo;t remember what changed, but soon they will be rendered obsolete on account of a new, big-ass patch from a concerned citizen.  I&rsquo;m also setting up CVS, so that will be available in the very near future.

the very, very, very first and uber-beta release of InstantManServant.  get it <a href="ims/files/ims-0.01.tar.gz">here</a>. I&rsquo;ve included toc.py v1.1 in there for the moment -- the first stable release will not include this, and you&rsquo;ll have to go get the latest.  also there is little or no documentation at the moment -- give me time!  It&rsquo;s pretty simple, tho, and if you wanna write a module, just call it mod$whatever.py, put it in your  ims directory, add a [mod$whatever] section to the config file, and put active=1 under it.  voila.  use the "moduptime.py" file as an example.  make sure you change the trigger value, too.
