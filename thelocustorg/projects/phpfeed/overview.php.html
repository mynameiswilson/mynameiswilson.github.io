<h1>phpfeed</h1>
<h2>overview</h2>
<p>
phpFeed is a php-powered RDF/RSS retrieval/display system.  the configuration file, like the RDF and RSS files, is contained in XML, making it easy to configure.  the html that formats the display of the RDF/RSS files is contained within easy-to-edit include files, and you can even specify your own CSS to style it to your own preferences.  <br>
<br>
in short, i made phpFeed as an easy alternative to have to script your own RSS/RDF puller/displayer.<br>
<br>
you should go and check out the <a href="demo.php.html">demo</a> and then, after i have WOWED you with my genius, <a href="download.php.html">download</a> it.<br>
<br>
you will need to have PHP 4.2.1, compiled with DOM XML support built in.  see the <a href="docs.php.html">documentation</a> for more information.
