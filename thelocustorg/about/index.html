<h1>About</h1>

<img src="../content/images/about/ben-crazyhat.jpg" alt="Ben with crazy hat" class="FloatRight" />

<p>Hi.  My name is Ben Wilson.</p>

<p>
I was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1978.  Save for a brief two-year stint in Southern By-God Indiana, I have lived in the River City all of my life.  I grew up in the East End (Middletown, to be specific), and now reside in Hikes Point.  For those of you who lived in Louisville, the next obvious question is &#8220;Where did you go to high school?&#8221;  Glad you asked!  I graduated from Eastern High School in 1996.  I attended the University of Louisville, and escaped with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) in the Winter of 2000.  
</p>

<p>Early on in my collegiate career, I met and fell in love with Kelly Brockman.  After college, we married in April of 2002, and have been happily married ever since.  On the professional side of things, I am currently a web-developer / systems designer / what-have-you for <a href="http://www.powercreative.com" class="External">Power Creative</a>, an advertising agency here in Louisville.

<p>
I love web design and development.  I do it for a living, and have also done a fair amount of freelance work, in addition to numerous personal <a href="../projects.html">side-projects</a>, most notable being the <a href="../blog.html">weblog</a>, which I wrote from scratch. Aside from that, I have a great admiration (infatuation) of <a href="../soaring.html">silent flight with model sailplanes</a>, DIY electronics, and <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery">photography</a>.  I&rsquo;m also a big music fan and listen to just about everything at least once.  If I had to choose a sport that I like above all others, it&rsquo;d have to be baseball (which I&rsquo;ve been known to play on occassion), with soccer being a close second.  I&rsquo;m also a big fan of cinema.  Politically, I lean to the left on most issues, but do have a fairly strong libertarian streak in me as well.  
</p>

<p>
The name "thelocust" actually did come from the indie band <a href="http://www.thelocust.com" class="External">The Locust</a>, but I&rsquo;ll admit to only having listened to a couple of tracks from them.  The real reason why I used it is because I stole a shirt from my brother once before I went bowling.  The shirt said "thelocust" on the front and "I ain&rsquo;t workin&rsquo; for the man no more" on the back.  I proceeded to bowl the best game in my life.  The nickname seemed to stick for whatever reason.  Sure, I&rsquo;ve probably outgrown it by now, but it&rsquo;s got 5 years of history behind it now!
</p>

<p>
I blog because I enjoy writing.  However, up until recently I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve really had a <i>feel</i> for it.  There is something about being able to broadcast to the world anything that pops into my head.  If I had a t-shirt that said "I (heart) the intarweb", you know I&rsquo;d wear it.
