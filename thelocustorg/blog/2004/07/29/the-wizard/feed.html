		<description><![CDATA[Hi!!  I wanted to let you know about the new fan website for the show.

There are definitely fans out there everywhere &amp; not just in the US.  The David Rappaport Pages is also definitely a site to check out &amp; now there is a site JUST for the show itself.  We are using it to gather the troops &amp; show 20th Century Fox that it&#039;s definitely missing out by not releasing the show to the public.

Sharing is great, but it&#039;s not going to get the show in to the hands of all the fans &amp; the show deserves more respect than passing around crummy copies.

Hope you check it out!!  Lots of pictures &amp; info &amp; I&#039;m no where near finished.  It will never really be finished.

Join the fight!!  THE WIZARD NEEDS YOU!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember this show, because this dude had a bag of tricks, and as I was 8 or 9 when it was on, I was thinking &quot;Hey, A-Team, I see you don&#039;t have a bag of tricks!  Well, I guess you might have one metaphorically, but certainly not for real!&quot;.  It was awesome.]]></description>
