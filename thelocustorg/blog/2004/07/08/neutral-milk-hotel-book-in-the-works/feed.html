		<description><![CDATA[As a painter I feel that the album Aeroplane over the sea is very inspirational, with it&#039;s ability to induce imaginative free-association visuals, and it&#039;s exciting energy and drama. I wish I was a musician, so I could let it inspire me to make sounds as thoughtful, and yet so loose and free. Perhaps the album&#039;s reputation will take time to sink in and spread, and it&#039;s influence will be felt years from now. I think it already has. My brother is a huge fan of Wilco, and I am anxious to show him that In the Aeroplane Over the Sea was made years before Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Not to suggest that Jeff Tweedy borrowed from NMH or that he isn&#039;t incredible. Infact, Tweedy probably  never  heard the album. Maybe Neutral Milk Hotel was simply one of the first band&#039;s to rethink the bounderies of pop-rock in a way that made it a new genre. I don&#039;t know. Maybe it&#039;s late and I&#039;m sleepy and delusional. All I know is In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is certainly one of my favorite albums, if not my favorite. And I liked your comment about hoping that music like this is never made again. Being influenced by it and making a personal reaction would be good, but trying to emmulate it might detract from it&#039;s beauty and just result in watered down, forced noise. (Forced Noise? Jeese, it is late.) The album is so unique, it&#039;s a great example of a highlight of any art form, in this case, pop-rock. Thanks.]]></description>
