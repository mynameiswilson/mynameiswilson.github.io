		<description><![CDATA[Sloe gin is interesting.  I can&#039;t say that I&#039;ve ever seem blackthorn plums (&quot;sloe plums&quot;)  before -- they apparently grow wild in Europe.  I&#039;ve only had one sloe gin myself, and I made it myself, so it probably wasn&#039;t quite right.

I think the best thing it has going for it is the name, really :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The women of country music are supposed to look plastic--have you ever taken a good look at Dolly Parton?

That one song about the sloe gin fizz implies they had an illicit love affair. My friends and I did all sorts of research about what goes into a sloe gin fizz while we were at the beach--we asked every bartender in Hilton Head. Finally we met this woman from Knoxville who had a friend named Dooner, whose mom used to own a bar, and she called Dooner and Dooner what was in one. So we came home from the beach and made them. A little sweet for my tastes, but if they&#039;re good enough for Loretty they&#039;re good enough for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly she does.  She&#039;s looking a little plastic on the cover of the album, but hoo-boy does she throw down!  It&#039;s no &quot;Fist City&quot; mind you, but it&#039;s pretty close.

You know she and Jack White had an illicit love affair.  He&#039;d do it just to keep up his odd media appearance.

(At least, if I was writing the script of his life, that&#039;d be how it would roll).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the music summary--I love that Loretta Lynn album--every song on it is just great. My friends and I listened to it last summer on our beach trip, so it brings me many happy memories. I also like Loretta&#039;s fabulous blue frilly dress on the album cover.]]></description>
