I got the news tonight that Ben Edelson passed away some time in the last couple of days.  Ben was a friend during my high-school years (actually only my senior year, 1996), a fellow Quick Recall teammate, fellow Downtown YMCA alarm-tripper and fellow guy named Ben.    He was and still is the nicest genius (certifiable!) I ever knew.  That was the thing about Ben &#8212; he was easily the smartest guy I&#8217;ve ever met, and yet despite all of the scholastic triumph that was always lumped (deservedly) upon him, he was a respectful friend to many.  That is what I loved, and I think the thing everyone loved about Ben.  He was incredibly smart (1600 on his SATs, winner of the 2000 Hoopes Prize for Undergraduate thesis while at Harvard), but despite his educational superlatives he was engaging, funny, filthy and always eager to please.  I rarely saw him in a bad mood and he hardly had an enemy.  As Hunter put it: &#8220;He&#8217;s the guy you&#8217;re <i>supposed</i> to hate, but can&#8217;t help loving&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
He went to Harvard after high-school and then went to CalTech, and received a number of accolades there, and occassionally we&#8217;d hear reports from the west coast of Edelson and his adventures.  The last time I saw him was probably well over a year ago, but when we did meet it was always a good time.  He was, to many of those who knew him, a true inspiration not only scholastically but personally.  He was always interested in not only knowing more about the world around him, but the people around him as well.  He was truly an independent in my book, one that I&#8217;ll never forget.
</p>
<p>Ben, where-ever you are, find me out again someday.</p>

			<p>Ben was my TA for chem, and in the short time that I knew him he really was all that you said. Thanks to him I never have to take a chem class again. Guys like that should never have to go away.</p>

			<p>Do I still have that video from Project: Graduation or do you?  Good times.  There are so many memories&#8230; and the funny thing is, so many different people have these memories of Ben.  There wasn&#8217;t anyone from any walk of life that he couldn&#8217;t make friends with.</p>

			<p>Thanks Ben. I know you and I didn&#8217;t know eachother well in school but I really think you summed up Ben in a nutshell. He was just all around great and nice to everyone&#8230;.even people who weren&#8217;t always nice to him.  He just had this charm! Sure he  was a smarty pants but he never let that alienate othet people. Plus, he was hysterical&#8230;.constantly&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe some of the things he said and got away with. I appreciate you doing this as well struggle to make 1 + 1=2 again after hearing the news.</p>

			<p>I played with Ben in the Caltech jazz band for two years.  One of the nicest guys I ever met.  He was always optimistic and a pleasure to play with.  We will miss him in our sectionals.  I&#8217;m grateful I got to know him.</p>

			<p>I was Ben&#8217;s band director, starting him on the saxophone in 4th grade and continuing through graduation from Eastern HS.  It&#8217;s with profound sadness and lack of  ability to find words to express my feelings about this news.<br />
I can&#8217;t think of a time when he was in a bad mood.  He was always smiling, friendly, and helpful to others.  He tutored a variable number of other kids every morning in the bandroom on every form of higher math.  He was an original member of the first Eastern jazz band, created the comedy troupe BAMF (that lives on today with mythical qualities), and loved to make music.<br />
Ben will be  missed by anyone that was lucky enough to know him.<br />

			<p>Thank you Mr. Hagan for you kind words about Ben. Although I wasn&#8217;t in the band at Eastern, many of my friends were and I&#8217;ve heard a lot about you (good in the winter, bad during marching season).</p>
<p>I was curious about if you were still at EHS and what IS going on with the new BAMF. Joe Crosser alerted me that it has become a club! When I created BAMF I had no idea it would outlast us. I just thought, &#8220;Hey my friends are funny.  Certainly other people would think we are funny too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope that someone mentions to BAMF (the club) that one of the founding members has passed. Joe, Kevin, Clint and I would like some tribute to Ben to occur during the next Vaudeville. It just wouldn&#8217;t be right for them to not know about him.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>p.s. Do they know what BAMF means even? Surely they must&#8230;.</p>

			<p>i just learned of ben&#8217;s passing this afternoon. i am deeply saddened and feel quite numb at the moment.</p>
<p>ben and i first met in either 3rd or 4th grade. he was a good friend all the way through high school. we lost touch during the past 5 or 6 years, a fact i am not proud of but a reality nonetheless.</p>
<p>ive spent the last few hours going over in my mind all these memories from band functions, basement parties, football games, history classes, movie nights, denny&#8217;s restaurants, honor club conventions, and ben getting lost in his car just about everywhere. he played a large part in all of these crazy/fun moments that helped shape and mold my high school experience and the experiences of so many others.</p>
<p>my thoughts are with his family and loved ones.</p>

			<p>ben&#8217;s loss is so difficult for us, but it is comforting to ann and me that so many of you felt so strongly about ben.  we have read your comments and smiled to recall the memories.  our rabbi said that ben&#8217;s soul was inspired by God, and will live on to create other acts of goodness and kindness. i am not profoundly religious, but i found that to be consoling. thank you all so much for your kind words.  to those of you in banf, if there is a tribute, please let us know.</p>

			<p>Just don&#8217;t know what to feel at the moment.  I hadn&#8217;t talked to Ben in a few years, but I always tried to keep up with where he was and what he was doing.  He was so smart, and funny; really, really funny.  I remember his absolute goofiness during quick recall matches (&#8220;a massachusetts yankee in king arthur&#8217;s court&#8221; comes to mind) and his ability to schmooze any teacher into getting out of class.  They just loved him.  We all did.<br />
He was the guy all they girls had a crush on (myself included).  He was the only smart guy ever voted favorite in class that I have ever heard of.  He could do it all.<br />
In the same mold as Casey, I&#8217;ll always remember the beast in the cold rainstorm, that silly isuzu trooper of his, watching airplane, quick recall orgasmic cookies, and marching band memories.<br />

			<p>I was deeply saddened to hear about Ben passing.  (My parents live next door to some good friends of the Edelson&#8217;s.)  I just got in from out of town and I decided to see if anything was online.  I was so pleasantly surprised to come across this webpage and see names like Ben Wilson, Julie Hoover, Hunter Dixon, and Jennifer Bergant (Brey?), etc.  First, it brought a smile to my face to see the names of my classmates but it also was heartwarming to read all of the kind things people had to say about Ben.  I can remember Ben from all the way back to middle school at Crosby when we used to go up against his school in Quick Recall and Math Bowl.  I feel honored to say that I was in almost every class with him in high school.  He was a class individual.  From math classes, to Senor Moore&#8217;s Spanish class, to Governor&#8217;s Scholars, Ben always had something thought provoking to say and always could bring a great laugh.  When I heard the news I immediately went to my 1996 yearbook to reminisce.  I was actually laughing at some of the things you (collectively) wrote.  My deepest condolences go out to the Edelson family.  I will not be able to at the services tomorrow but my father will attend the visitation.  I hope to see you all soon.  As a sidenote, this is a great blog.  I was glad to find it.  Take care</p>

			<p>I can only echo the sentiments that others have already expressed. Ben was both a role model and a friend of mine throughout high school; his passing is devastating on many levels.</p>
<p>Perhaps some solace may be found in the amazing way that Ben affected every life that he touched and that he left the world a far better place than when he arrived.</p>

			<p>thank you all for putting this up on the internet for those of us no longer near anyone who knew ben&#8230;</p>
<p>i knew him for a much shorter time than most of you, but in a relatively close way: he was my grad-student mentor for about six months in the dervan lab last winter &#038; spring (i was a lowly undergrad).  he made me learn the little bit of chemistry we were using &#038; taught me a lot&#8230; i even think i should have listened to his advice and gone to harvard, but i didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>this morning i was shocked when i saw an email from rachel (another ug in the lab) with the news &#8211; she had sent it a few days ago but i don&#8217;t check that account.<br />
it still hasn&#8217;t fully sunk in.</p>

			<p>I only found out about Ben’s passing yesterday.  I knew Ben in high school largely through band (jazz, marching, and pep).  I would like to share one memory I have of Ben regarding a short essay that he wrote for The Eagle’s Quill, Eastern High School’s literary magazine.  The essay, “The Sacred Cheese of Life”, was about how cheese and music are alike.  I remember Ben sitting in the band room trying to come up with as many types of cheese as  possible to incorporate into the essay.  He compared camembert to classical music, parmesan to alternative, and of course Velveeta to muzak.  I pulled it out just now and reread the essay.  At the end Ben writes “The most important thing in life is to keep the exuberance about having the chance to simply exist each minute of every day.  And cheese and music have helped millions, perhaps billions, achieve that goal.”  That’s Ben as I will always remember him, one whose exuberance for life, love of humor, and appreciation of music were contagious.</p>

			<p>I am deeply saddened by the news of Ben&#8217;s passing.  I knew him as a classmate, a band member and I considered him to be a friend.  I know I wasn&#8217;t as close to him as many of you, but Ben was the kind of person that to know him, was to consider him a friend.  I think he was friend to everyone he came in contact with.  I remember his energy to be contagious; his talents and intelligence I respected so very much.  As I read over some of the names that have written (Ben Wilson, Wayne Davis, Nick &#8220;Herb&#8221; Walters), I can&#8217;t help but reflect on some of those high school memories.  Ben was a person who I&#8217;ll remeber with great fondness when I look back on EHS.  I am glad I had the opportunity to meet him, know him and consider him a friend.  My prayers go out to his family.</p>

			<p>Almost one year has passed and I decided to visit the site about my son again.  This has been a difficult year and at this time things are very bad.  However, reading about Ben as he was seen by his friends helps.  In case anyone reads this I would love to hear how you are doing.  I am a grandma to a beautiful girl-Rayah.  She is helping in so many ways to get through life.  She would have loved her Uncle Ben.  He always said that he would send a box of the rice to Aaron &#038; Britt when  they had a child.

			<p>Hi ann and rich,</p>
<p> So many people felt so strongly about Ben because he made a huge difference in so many people&#8217;s lives! He always made people laugh and smile and he was so much fun to be around. Ben&#8217;s soul was inspired by God and will live on to create other acts of goodness and kindness. Ben was a wonderful friend to have!! He was very smart and bright! He was very talented. I found the weblog about Ben last night and I think it is wonderful and the tribute video is Excellent, Ben inspired so many people. I love what you guys have done here!!</p>

			<p>Though I haven&#8217;t met most (or really any) of the folks on this site, I knew Ben briefly at Harvard and then as a roommate at Caltech for two years (fall 2000 to summer 2002). I&#8217;m still haunted by his sudden and untimely demise and think on occassion about what the world is missing without him here. I decided on a whim and a sense of nostalgia to google his name today and came accross this site and the lovely tribute. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen him and it was moving to watch the images of a dear, lost friend. I wish I had been able to attend his services at the time, but this site has helped me reach some closure. Thanks for making, posting and maintaining this memorial.
