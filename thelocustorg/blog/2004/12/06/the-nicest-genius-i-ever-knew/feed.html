		<description><![CDATA[Though I haven&#039;t met most (or really any) of the folks on this site, I knew Ben briefly at Harvard and then as a roommate at Caltech for two years (fall 2000 to summer 2002). I&#039;m still haunted by his sudden and untimely demise and think on occassion about what the world is missing without him here. I decided on a whim and a sense of nostalgia to google his name today and came accross this site and the lovely tribute. It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve seen him and it was moving to watch the images of a dear, lost friend. I wish I had been able to attend his services at the time, but this site has helped me reach some closure. Thanks for making, posting and maintaining this memorial.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi ann and rich,

 So many people felt so strongly about Ben because he made a huge difference in so many people&#039;s lives! He always made people laugh and smile and he was so much fun to be around. Ben&#039;s soul was inspired by God and will live on to create other acts of goodness and kindness. Ben was a wonderful friend to have!! He was very smart and bright! He was very talented. I found the weblog about Ben last night and I think it is wonderful and the tribute video is Excellent, Ben inspired so many people. I love what you guys have done here!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am glad to see people are still visiting this blog, it is a great tribute.  I dated Ben in college and was deeply affected by his death, as was everyone.  Recently I decided to participate in a 22 mile overnight fundraising walk for the American Society for Suicide Prevention in his honor.  If any of you would like to learn more about the event or make a donation in his memory, please go to

thank you

		<description><![CDATA[...is hard for many of us, especially with the memory of Ben.  It seems that thoughts of him and the other friends that I have lost come back to me -- as Hunter put it -- &quot;when I slow down&quot;.

I am glad to hear that a new family member is lifting your spirits a bit.  And, as a fellow Ben, I agree that a box of rice is in order :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost one year has passed and I decided to visit the site about my son again.  This has been a difficult year and at this time things are very bad.  However, reading about Ben as he was seen by his friends helps.  In case anyone reads this I would love to hear how you are doing.  I am a grandma to a beautiful girl-Rayah.  She is helping in so many ways to get through life.  She would have loved her Uncle Ben.  He always said that he would send a box of the rice to Aaron &amp; Britt when  they had a child.  That is the Ben that makes me smile.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for what you have posted on your site.  I am terribly saddened that Ben passed away even though I hadn&#039;t seen him in a few years.  I posted a few pictures on my site from time that we spent together in college.  I miss him.

		<description><![CDATA[I am deeply saddened by the news of Ben&#039;s passing.  I knew him as a classmate, a band member and I considered him to be a friend.  I know I wasn&#039;t as close to him as many of you, but Ben was the kind of person that to know him, was to consider him a friend.  I think he was friend to everyone he came in contact with.  I remember his energy to be contagious; his talents and intelligence I respected so very much.  As I read over some of the names that have written (Ben Wilson, Wayne Davis, Nick &quot;Herb&quot; Walters), I can&#039;t help but reflect on some of those high school memories.  Ben was a person who I&#039;ll remeber with great fondness when I look back on EHS.  I am glad I had the opportunity to meet him, know him and consider him a friend.  My prayers go out to his family.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just heard about all this a few days ago through Nick W.  i have lost touch with so many especially since my family moved from there a few years ago.  Ben had a profound effect on so many.  He touched everyone in different ways.  Many of you knew him much better then I did but I have many fond memories of him.  i think it is wonderful to see a tribute like this and to see that so many care.  He will never be forgotten and will live on through all who remember him.]]></description>
