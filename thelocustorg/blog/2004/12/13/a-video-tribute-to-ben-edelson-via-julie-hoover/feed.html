		<description><![CDATA[I am a graduate student at MIT and I was an undergrad at Caltech. Ben was my Organic Chemistry TA. He was an amazing person and I still miss him. Today I watched some videos from the &quot;it gets better project&quot; on youtube and thought about how that idea applies to graduate students too. It made me think of Ben and stumble on this web post. I wish Ben would have stuck around until things got better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though I haven&#039;t met most (or really any) of the folks on this site, I knew Ben briefly at Harvard and then as a roommate at Caltech for two years (fall 2000 to summer 2002).  I&#039;m still haunted by his sudden and untimely demise and think on occassion about what the world is missing without him here.  I decided on a whim and a sense of nostalgia to google his name today and came accross this site and the lovely tribute.  It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve seen him and it was moving to watch the images of a dear, lost friend.  I wish I had been able to attend his services at the time, but this site has helped me reach some closure.  Thanks for making, posting and maintaining this memorial.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aaron,

 None of us will ever know or understand why Ben didn&#039;t reach out to any of us in his time of need. There are so many questions that are still unanswered and may never be answered. We all would have given our lives to save his. Ben is and always will be loved and will forever be missed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When me and my parents first got the call that night about Ben its like we couldn&#039;t believe it. When my mom first told me that Ben was dead its like my whole body went numb and I couldn&#039;t move. Ben was a wonderful friend to have. He was funny, very very smart and bright! He always made people smile and laugh and he had so many friends. Ben is a Genius!! I think about him all the time. I miss him so much! He will be missed dearly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just got off the phone with Kaylie who informed me of the bad news.  I could not believe what she had said, certainly not Ben. I remember him as being this sweet, happy and super smart guy.  I&#039;m sure that he will be missed dearly as he had such a presence about him.  My condolances to his family and friends.]]></description>
