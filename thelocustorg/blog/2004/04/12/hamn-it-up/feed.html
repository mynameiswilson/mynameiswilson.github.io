		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s really not &quot;girl repellant&quot;.  Personally, I much perfer the &quot;nerds&quot; to the jocks, etc.  The nerd factor only becomes a problem when guys expect us all to be Lara Croft.  While this is probably not a problem from which either you or Geoff suffer, you can trust me that there are many who do.  As long as a guy doesn&#039;t expect me to take up all *his* hobbies, I can handle just about anything, except perhaps (as I often say)  heroin.

And congratulations on your new adventure!  Use your powers for good, not evil.  ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[...that I&#039;m diggin&#039; this blog&#039;s new look.

Next, far be it from me to comment on the potential nerdiness or repellent nature of your hobbies, considering that some of  my own interests (theatre, children&#039;s literature, books in general) could very well be categorized as &quot;man repellent.&quot;

And finally,  yeah, I&#039;ve been to the Marconi Station. On a date, as it happens. I didn&#039;t go inside, but I can say that the parking lot affords a lovely ocean view. :)]]></description>

Geoff and I collectively call our hobbies &quot;girl repellent&quot; :)

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats, Ben.  Though cheap cell phones with free long distance and the Inter-web have conspired to steal some of the thunder away from Ham Radio, it is still fun to talk to nice people on the other side of the world with a piece of wire in your back yard as an antenna.   Your talent at building things will serve you well.  Have fun...
