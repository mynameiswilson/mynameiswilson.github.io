		<description><![CDATA[I am quite jealous!  That&#039;s going to be a great time!  A word of advice though...should you find any miniature tiki dolls, do not, I repeat, do not take it back to your hotel room!  ;)

Gary and Mayumi:  Many blessings to you both!  I&#039;m sure the ceremony will be beautiful.  Namaste, Holly]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a fun start to a great vacation. We&#039;ll miss you here at work, almost certainly more than you will be missing us.  Big HI to Kelly and Gary and anyone else I know out there. Don&#039;t drink to much bourbon cause you know it&#039;s also called &quot;forgettin&#039; juice&quot;.

You lugged Cryptonomicon out there for twelve pages?  Bad ROI  IMHO...

73,
