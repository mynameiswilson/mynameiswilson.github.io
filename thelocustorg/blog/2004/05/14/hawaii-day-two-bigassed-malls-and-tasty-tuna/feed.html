		<description><![CDATA[Furusato - depending on the kanji, it could mean &#039;old sugar&#039; if you&#039;re REALLY creative with the way you write it or... it means, &#039;one&#039;s hometown&#039;, which sounds quaint and is most likely the correct interpretation.

Phili-rolls, &#039;scoff&#039;&#039;.  Still, I&#039;m sure the sushi there is dynamite. As for the not-so-hip Japanese chickies sporting Von Dutch trucker caps, Im glad to hear that fad has already come and gone in the US. Its an epidemic here. You can buy those things at convenience stores here. In fact, the other day, I saw a homeless guy sporting one. I think its safe to say the trend is long over and done with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[and then i&#039;ll have nothing left!  it&#039;s true.  i saw it in a movie once.  kelly has also recently upgraded to wearing shorts(!), and also short skirts!  Me, I think it&#039;s really hot.  But then again, I think everything she does is hot.  I know for a fact she derived at least a little pleasure out of your comment -- but she&#039;ll never say it herself.

Anyway -- yeah, I&#039;m A-OK #1 with Hawaii time.  It hasn&#039;t been that bad, really.  I&#039;m a little early-tired tonight, but I think that&#039;s because of all the swimming and malling and whatnot today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You absolutely disappear when viewed from the side. Please point me to your exercise/diet/life plan immediately.

Also, am so envious that you two are in Hawaii because 1) it&#039;s gorgeous, and 2) I seem to have been born with my body clock set on Hawaii time; the one time I was there was the only time in my life I&#039;ve been able to wake up early without feeling sleep-deprived.

But that&#039;s my ridiculous cross to bear. Have a great time! (As if there&#039;s any other option.)]]></description>
