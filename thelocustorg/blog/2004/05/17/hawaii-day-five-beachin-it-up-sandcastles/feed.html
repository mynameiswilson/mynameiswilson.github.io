		<description><![CDATA[well, actually i&#039;m *glad* i didn&#039;t go to the submarine -- we would have missed out on the chance to hike to the top of Diamond Head crater, as we just squeaked in before closin&#039; time.  So, boo-hoo, no submarine, but it&#039;s not like I haven&#039;t seen The Hunt for Red October or Das Boot.  Or U-571 (the one where Bon Jovi gets decapitated by a flying hatch).  No regrets.]]></description>
