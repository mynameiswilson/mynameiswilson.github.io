		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, I slogged through the rain to cast my &quot;No&quot; vote for you... as Kelly says, if there had been a &quot;HELL no&quot; option I&#039;d have filled in the circle for that one.  You know and I know and everyone else who voted against this asinine amendment knows that this will be a huge embarassment to Kentucky (and the sooner the better).

Before your friend leaves, Ben, tell him to write to his congressman... no sense in making a statement if you don&#039;t actually make it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to diminish the short term effects of this ridiculous and futile piece of legislation, but I see it as the last desperate gasps of a dying ideology.

I was listening to this great piece on NPR and I agree with the commentator that says we liberals need to coopt the word &quot;morality.&quot;  We *do* have morals and by god (pun intended), some of them are even religiously/spiritually based.  They are about grace, humility, humanity and kindness; and yes, hope, faith, charity and love.  The conservatives do not own these words!  We&#039;re all so afraid of stepping on each other&#039;s toes that we can&#039;t even bring ourselves to say &quot;It is my Hindu beliefs that allow me to embrace the radical spiritualist that was Jesus of Nazareth!&quot;  Or vice versa.  The details are unimportant.  Or even just to respect and acknowledge our different belief systems and common values.  We liberals have a unifying spirit, if not belief, even the atheists.  It is one where everyone has the right to respect.  So, forget the connotation of &quot;morality.&quot;   Semantics.  Call it &quot;ethical morality&quot; if you must, but take it, make it your own!  By my view, they&#039;re the immoral ones.

In the end, what did we all expect from a bunch of people who refuse to evolve--or should I say &quot;change over time&quot;?  ;)]]></description>
