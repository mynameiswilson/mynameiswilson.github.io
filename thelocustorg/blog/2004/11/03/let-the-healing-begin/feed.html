Is Fanta flamable?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some pundit made an interesting point about Hillary.  S/he said that part of George Bush&#039;s success was that people who liked him, really like him; and people who hated him, really hated him.  This led to Karl Rove&#039;s strategy of targeting districts where Bush underperformed in 2000- to get out more of the Republican faithful.  Anyway, the point was made that Hillary is the same kind of polarizing figure, but because of that could increase Democratic turnout in a similar fashion.

I&#039;m not sold on Edwards.  I think that with all the restructuring the Democratic Party is going through, and will go through over the next four years, if an Edwards &#039;08 campaign might not seem like &quot;more of the same&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After two close losses (arguably) to a monkey like W, I don&#039;t think the Dems will be taking any chances on the next election, and a female candidate is a huge chance.  Not only that, but a lot of middle-Americans have vehement feelings about Hillary, and it&#039;s obviously their &quot;values&quot; that prevailed in this election.

The American people apparently want a simple President.  A very simple President.  If the Dems are smart, they&#039;ll pick their guy now, start positioning him to make a run in 08, and save the smart and complex politicians for his Cabinet.  I think Edwards might be able to pull  it off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) Hillary Clinton
she&#039;s been prophesied for so long, i find it hard to imagine she&#039;d be able to stay away from the election in 2008. whether she can win or not, i&#039;m not sure, it depends on how she campaigns. but after four more years of Bush, i&#039;d be surprised if the people wouldn&#039;t be willing to elect The Penguin.

2) John Edwards
i&#039;ve already seen two or three pundits writing lengthy articles about Edwards&#039; viability as a candidate in &#039;08. he&#039;s definitely got charm, charisma, and an ability to connect with the &quot;common man.&quot; i&#039;m actually leaning towards Edwards, though i&#039;d be thrilled to see another contender who can supplant him.

as for Obama, i think he&#039;ll bide his time. gain some more political experience, shine that rising star for another decade before he makes a run. if Hillary or Edwards win in &#039;08, and if a second term looks likely, i fully expect Obama to be the first African American president in &#039;16.]]></description>
