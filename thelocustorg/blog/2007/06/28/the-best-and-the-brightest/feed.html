		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little late to the post, but I didn&#039;t find out until recently about Chip&#039;s death.  A Google search led me here.  I was a co-captain on that Quick Recall team of &quot;heavyweights&quot; with Chip and counted him a close friend.  Unfortunately, life took me a different direction and I lost track of him until I heard of this.  He was great guy and, despite how his life ended, I&#039;m glad someone memorialized him properly.  So, thank you.

Almost as shocking to me is the death of Ben Edelson, who I also squared off against (and likely this site&#039;s host as well) in Quick Recall.  I can&#039;t really call him a friend, but I knew him and liked him, and he occassionally hung out with the Manual students (he dated Stacy Cook, a classmate of mine, if I remember right).  

Two guys lost way too early to disturbing circumstances.  But it&#039;s good they are remembered.]]></description>
