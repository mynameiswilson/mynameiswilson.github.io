		<description><![CDATA[There used to be some Critical Mass&#039;ers around Louisville, but you don&#039;t hear much about them any more.  I remember them late in college and then shortly thereafter.  Here&#039;s a bit about them on the Louisville Bicycle Club website:

		<description><![CDATA[We have our own unique bike culture out here. There&#039;s a group called Critical Mass that rides through downtown during evening rush hour on the last Friday of every month or something. There&#039;s a reason we call them the &quot;massholes.&quot; That being said, I&#039;m all for the bike riding and wish it were easier for cars and bikes and pedestrians to coexist. I read about some city like Amsterdam or something (you know, one of those crazy drug utopian cities that are full of smart, industrious people who are constantly high.) Anyway, they wisely put the bike lane between the sidewalk and the cars parallel parked along the roadside. It&#039;s such a simple idea, but like most simple ideas, is also totally brilliant. Will that ever make it in the U.S.? Maybe someday. When I get my unicorn.]]></description>
