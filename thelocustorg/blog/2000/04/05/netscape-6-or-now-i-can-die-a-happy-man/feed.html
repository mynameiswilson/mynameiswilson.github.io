		<description><![CDATA[ok.  I watched a documentary on the Netscape coders last night.  They seem like actual people to me now.  Consider this my public apology to Netscape.  I&#039;ll try version 6 at home. If it craps out there, I&#039;ll wait for the final release.  If THAT craps out, then I&#039;ll start bitching again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a tip for anybody posting here...DO NOT TRY TO USE DOUBLE-QUOTES IN YOUR TEXT!  You end up posting 3 or 4 partial messages and looking like a total boob.  Well, it&#039;s probably not that far from the truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I downloaded it.  I installed it.  I said `What the fu*k?`
The thing takes forever to load.  Once it&#039;s loaded, the UI is horrible.  I tried using the mail client..BIG mistake.  The mail client is buggy as an insectorium.  I would have uninstalled it, but it doesn&#039;t come with uninstall capability.  You can&#039;t even use `Add/Remove programs` from the control panel to get rid of this thing.  Netscape, Schmetscape.  IE may be a tool of the Devil, but at least the damn thing works.  I guess this is just a side affect of AOL&#039;s involvement.]]></description>
