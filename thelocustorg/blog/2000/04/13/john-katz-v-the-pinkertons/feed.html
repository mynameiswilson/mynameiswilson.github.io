People who keep their heads in the sand.  People who just don&#039;t care.  Do you ever feel like you&#039;re standing on a cliff at the edge of the ocean screaming to the waves, and not only do they not respond, but you don&#039;t even know what or why you&#039;re screaming?  Why don&#039;t people care about things unless they directly affect them?  Is it so fucking impossible to learn a single god damned lesson from history?  Jesus, I need to switch to decaf.]]></description>
