		<description><![CDATA[He was attacked by an ostrich, nearly mortally wounded if it wasn&#039;t for his hip flask stopping the razor sharp ostrich-fangs!  Unfortunately, it required 240 stitches!  To quell the pain, he turned to his old pal, Jim Beam.  Lost in the spiral of drugs and alcohol, he nearly died!  14 years sober, he&#039;s finally making a comeback!  Way to go Bush!]]></description>
