		<description><![CDATA[I always think it&#039;s fun to write the word SCIENCE in caps.  Comments: firstly, I always think it&#039;s interesting (as a philosopher of science wanna be) to see how close our (human&#039;s) feelings (ie Mr. Dixon&#039;s feelings in this case) can come to approaching scientific theories.  Although I&#039;m sure Mr. Dixon is aware of Einsteinian theories that equate time and space, it&#039;s interesting to hear similar thoughts expressed from a different perspective.  I could probably write much more on this, but I&#039;m much more of a dialoguer than a writer.  Thanks for the insightful article luv.]]></description>
