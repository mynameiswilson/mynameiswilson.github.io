		<description><![CDATA[Well, i just don&#039;t know anymore.  While I think there *might* be the slimmest of a Democratic chance out there, the legal battles are still good because finally there is a chance to get something done about them.  If those legal issue were brought up in a year without and election, or a year with a decisive election, less weight would be put on them to be resolved.  So, this year, the ballot will be cleaned up, voting will hopefully be standardized to a point, and we can get on with things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you think the Democrats should concede, then why are the legal battles a good thing?  Don&#039;t they stand in the way of a concession and a clear transfer of power?  Frankly, I think that Bush should concede to Gore if Gore truly does carry the popular vote.  It will never in a million years happen but hopefully one good result of all this will be a reform of the electoral college system, which I feel is antiquated to say the least.
And as I&#039;ve said before, there are still counties to be re-recounted, plus overseas ballots, plus the legal battles you mentioned, so this is far from over.  To quote Dan Rather: &quot;Bush&#039;s lead is shakier than cafeteria jello.&quot;
BTW, this week&#039;s Onion has a great article in which Bush/Gore wins.  It highlights how similar the two candidates are.  There are obviously differences, but when compared to anything that&#039;s further left OR right than the center, they start to seem a lot alike.  Meet the new boss indeed.  Okay, I&#039;m done for awhile, as this whole posting things and replying is merely a high-tech way for us to have a conversation.]]></description>
