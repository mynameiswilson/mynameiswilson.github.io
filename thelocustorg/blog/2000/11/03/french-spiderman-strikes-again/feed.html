		<description><![CDATA[Nice links, Ben.  Especially enjoyable was the exact procedure for caning someone.  Note to self...  I wonder if he&#039;s ever been psychologically examined.  I also wish he would give a different reason for doing what he does than that the buildings are there, and that skyscrapers are urban mountains.  What really goes on in the mind of the Spiderman?]]></description>
