		<description><![CDATA[Sweet stuff.  So far I&#039;m enjoying this.  Between this and hearing stuff from Radiohead (a track from Kid A) this morning and two cuts from U2&#039;s new album on WFPK (just about the only station in Louisville I can listen to regularly, btw) this week is becoming acceptable musically.  Hell, earlier this morning I was even listening to the Velvet Underground (White Light, White Heat) and I wasn&#039;t horribly depressed!]]></description>
