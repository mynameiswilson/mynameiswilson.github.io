<p>
I got the news tonight that Ben Edelson passed away some time in the last couple of days.  Ben was a friend during my high-school years (actually only my senior year, 1996), a fellow Quick Recall teammate, fellow Downtown YMCA alarm-tripper and fellow guy named Ben.    He was and still is the nicest genius (certifiable!) I ever knew.  That was the thing about Ben &#8212; he was easily the smartest guy I&#8217;ve ever met, and yet despite all of the scholastic triumph that was always lumped (deservedly) upon him, he was a respectful friend to many.  That is what I loved, and I think the thing everyone loved about Ben.  He was incredibly smart (1600 on his SATs, winner of the 2000 Hoopes Prize for Undergraduate thesis while at Harvard), but despite his educational superlatives he was engaging, funny, filthy and always eager to please.  I rarely saw him in a bad mood and he hardly had an enemy.  As Hunter put it: &#8220;He&#8217;s the guy you&#8217;re <i>supposed</i> to hate, but can&#8217;t help loving&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
He went to Harvard after high-school and then went to CalTech, and received a number of accolades there, and occassionally we&#8217;d hear reports from the west coast of Edelson and his adventures.  The last time I saw him was probably well over a year ago, but when we did meet it was always a good time.  He was, to many of those who knew him, a true inspiration not only scholastically but personally.  He was always interested in not only knowing more about the world around him, but the people around him as well.  He was truly an independent in my book, one that I&#8217;ll never forget.
</p>
<p>Ben, where-ever you are, find me out again someday.</p>

Holiday cheer has come to my beloved Interactive Department here at <a href="http://www.powercreative.com" class="External">work</a> in the form of a $16 Christmas tree from Walmart.  Mix with left-over lights and a bevy of plushie animals, and you have the makings of mirth in tree form.

On a side note, Thanksgiving was also very nice.  We house-hopped between Indiana and Kentucky and had a good time all around.  The holidays are starting off well this year.</p>

	    <p>
I&#8217;ll tell you <i>with considerable pride</i> that I haven&#8217;t given more than the compulsory two minutes of my attention to the Laci Peterson case.  It really wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision so much as that is how little I watch network news and read the local paper. If it were a conscious decision to avoid this stuff, it&#8217;d probably have been more like a couple hours of my life wasted on a murder (notice I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;alleged&#8221;) way across the country.  As a side note to my lack of awareness on this case:  NPR&#8217;s search engine shows that they have only TWO articles <a href="http://search.npr.org/search97cgi/s97_cgi?cleanQuery=Laci&#038;ResultTemplate=allow_re_sort.hts&#038;SortSpec=Date+Desc+Score+Desc&#038;ViewTemplate=docview.hts&#038;collection=ALL02&#038;Action=FilterSearch&#038;filter=topic_filter.NEW.hts&#038;QueryText=" class="External">containing the term &#8220;Laci&#8221;</a>, as compared to the some 30 articles <a href="http://search.npr.org/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&#038;filter=topic_filter.NEW.hts&#038;ResultTemplate=allow_re_sort.hts&#038;SortSpec=Date+Desc+Score+Desc&#038;ResultMaxDocs=1000&#038;QueryText=&#038;CleanQuery=Arctic+National+Wildlife+Refuge&#038;x=56&#038;y=4&#038;how_long_ago=all&#038;collection=ALL02" class="External">dealing with the &#8220;Artic National Wildlife Refuge&#8221;</a>.  I think that explains it pretty well.</p>
<p>
Further, Louisville has had a <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/2004/11/06ky/B1-homicides11060-6052.html" class="External">bona-fide rash of murders</a> in it&#8217;s own right the last couple of weeks.  At least seven within the last week, totalling some 60 for the year, a figure that far outweighs the 2 people killed by Scott Peterson both in number and personal relevance.
</p>
<p>
As I heard the father of the most recently slain boy (17-year-old Johnathan Watson) in Louisville say this morning (paraphrased): &#8220;I just want everyone with the guns to know that, yeah, you&#8217;re the big men today &#8212; but know this &#8212; you didn&#8217;t just kill a boy, you killed a whole family.&#8221;  So, while the death of Laci Peterson and their unborn child is certainly tragic and reprehensible, we&#8217;ve got 60 families <i>right here in town</i> that could use a little more attention.</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>That&#8217;s right, the capital &#8220;A&#8221; Audiophile in me made me reconsider how I rip CDs into the digital MP3 format.  At lunch today I did a little looking around at the current ripping/encoding systems available for the PC.  After a little deliberation, I have found that there are two tools that are considering the audiophile standard for digital music.  First is <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/" class="External">Exact Audio Copy</a> (EAC), a ripper that I find better than they venerable <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/">CDex</a>, due in part to EAC&#8217;s sophisticated error checking and error recovery methods.
</p>
<p>Further, I found that the choice encoder is (as it has always been) <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/" class="External">LAME</a> (LAME Isn&#8217;t an MP3 Encoder).  However, earlier this year someone tweaked version 3.90.3 of LAME for ever finer audio reproduction.  There are a couple of presets in LAME now called &#8220;Alt Presets&#8221;.  The most popular of these presets is &#8220;Alt Preset Standard&#8221;.  This makes a stereo, approximately 256kbps variable-bit-rate MP3 file of exquisite quality.  The filesize is a little larger over that of my previous modus-encoderi of stereo 192kbps constant-bit-rate, but the quality of the music is much better (at least in headphones).
</p>
<p>
I did a little comparative testing with my brand-spanking-new copy of <a href="http://www.interpolny.com/" class="External">Interpol</a>&#8216;s newest album, <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/i/interpol/antics.shtml" class="External">Antics</a>.  The results were, to my ears, astounding.  I&#8217;ve heard stereo 256kbps VBR and I ain&#8217;t going back!
</p>
<p>
On a side note, I should mention that <i>Antics</i> is a really awesome album &#8212; much like their previous hailed effort <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/303" class="External">Turn on the Bright Lights</a>, it might require a few listenings for it to sink in.  However, after it has sunk in, you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to not hum their solid rhythms to yourself, while secretly wishing it was snowing outside. File under: <i>Winter music</i>.</p>

Before the election, and before the overwhelming win for the <a href="http://lrc.ky.gov/lrcpubs/2004_const_amendment_1.pdf" class="External">Kentucky Gay Marriage Amendment</a>, our local super-church, <a href="https://thelocust.org/www.southeastchristian.org/" class="External">South East Christian</a> helped to support this amendment with their &#8220;<a href="http://www.southeastchristian.org/weddings_same.cfm" class="External">One Man, One Woman</a>&#8221; campaign.  This campaign involved numerous billboards and mobile advertising and through their weighty clout and coffers, I think they helped to steel conservative opinion around Louisville at least, where the measure passed 60% YES / 40% NO 20-point margin.  The rest of the state voted 75/25 YES/NO.  Certainly a win for SouthEast and their campaign, and it could be said for Christians state-wide.</p>
<p>
Now, while SouthEast claims that &#8220;The same-sex marriage controversy is NOT ABOUT&#8230; homophobia, [or] whether homosexuals are nice people, good citizens, loving parents, loyal friends or helpful neighbors&#8221;, they forgot to mention that this amendment not only bars gays from &#8220;marriage&#8221;, but also from the lesser charge of &#8220;civil unions&#8221; which grants them the same rights as a &#8220;wedded couple&#8221; which includes any number of legal rights, including inheritance, life insurance, medical decisions, etc.  Oddly enough, South East has left this out of their website, on any page dealing with &#8220;gay marriage&#8221;.  However, on a funny ha-ha sidenote, they do reference a number of scientific studies in their defense of marriage.  To quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recognition that marriage is the union of male and female has never been seriously questioned in America until the past decade. During that time, activists were busy promoting their own private social revolution, and scientists were busy studying the institution of marriage and its affect on the participants and on society.</p>
<p>The results of hundreds of scientific studies and years of sociological research is undisputable. There is a mountain of evidence demonstrating the rewards to society as well as to individual families of marriage.</p>
<p>This is not an indictment of single-parent families; it is a scientific understanding of the dynamics of family structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wow, hey!  While you&#8217;re thumbing through scientific reports, why not read up on evolution as well!  It&#8217;s just a letter away from &#8220;faggotry&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
I respect SouthEast&#8217;s opinion and the opinion of the lawmakers who support this tripe, but did the lawmakers have to go and completely ban even <i>civil unions</i>?  I guess they figured that if they hooped and hollered about marriage enough that they could squeak in some verbiage about civil unions and just really kill the whole thing once and for all.  That is some pork-barrel baby and the bath water sort of shenanigans that I really hate to see.  To bar marriage from homosexuals is one thing, to categorically and systematically bar them from the rights regarded to any other wedded &#8212; or joined &#8212; couple is just ridiculous.  This is a major setback for a very large and very real segment of our society that is not going to &#8220;go away&#8221;.  Well, I take that back &#8212; if you wanted to rid the state of gays, well, you&#8217;ve made a step in the right direction, Kentucky!</p>
<p>
That, of course, brings me to my final point &#8212; Kentucky is attempting a <a href="http://www.kentucky.gov/brand/">branding initiative</a> that will create a singular, unified logo for the state.  You, citizen, can even <a href="http://www.kentucky.gov/brandvote/" class="External">vote for your favorite logo</a>.  (On a side note:  the agency that got the state&#8217;s business is New West, and according to a little bird New West is shipping a great deal of the some $14 million state ad budget down South to Atlanta in the form of contract work! Thanks Gov. Fletcher!  Keep it in the state, man!)  Anyway, I figure that at least this time the state is giving the public some choice in what logo will represent the state, rather than <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/2002/local/12/27/plates.html" class="External">foisting some candy-assed design on us</a>.   Hey!  Kentucky &#8212; <i>It&#8217;s That Friendly</i> (except to gays). Well, in that spirit of public consideration and contribution, I submit my own Kentucky logo:</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/jine.jpg" alt="jine" /></p>
<p>
<i>jine</i>: antiquated and poetic version of &#8220;to join&#8221;, or perhaps &#8220;to agree with&#8221;.  Note usage here in <a href="http://www.civilwar.com/confed17.htm" class="External">this old Civil War bar shanty</a>.</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>This is the text of an email from a friend of mine (who is gay) in reaction to the Kentucky Anti-Gay Marriage Amendment which passed this last Tuesday&#8230;</p>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>As most of you are probably aware, the majority of voters in Kentucky, along with 10 other states across our fine nation, just placed a ban on same sex marriage into the state constitution, effectively endorsing discrimination as a model practice.  I am sitting here very nearly in tears right now because what this means is that the state that I was born in, and spent the first 24 years of my life in, has decided that I am not entitled to the same respect or the same sense of basic human dignity that 90% of the country&#8217;s population is automatically accorded.  What this means is that my monogamous relationship with my boyfriend of three years is worth less than my father&#8217;s less lengthy relationship with a woman from another country; it is worth less than the second marriage of my mother; it is even worth less than a 55 hour practical joke perpetrated by Britney<br />
Spears.  It is, in fact, worth nothing in Kentucky.</p>
<p>What this means is that I cannot, and will not, ever be a resident of Kentucky again.</p>
<p>Maybe this seems a bit extreme to some of you, but I&#8217;d ask you to try to see this from my perspective.  The state I have spent the vast majority of my life in, the one that educated me and collected my tax dollars, has now decided it knows better than I do when it comes to my relationship.  All I can think is &#8220;What right do you have to tell me who I can marry?  What right do you have to determine that my relationship is worth less than your own?  What right do you have to presume to speak for God?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people, maybe some of you, think this fight was about giving special rights to gay people.  This could not be further from the truth.  It was, and is, about affording equal rights to every tax-paying citizen of this country.  In fact, the only people with &#8220;special rights&#8221; in this respect are heterosexuals:  straight people have the right to marry, gay people do not.  Straight people have the right to inherit property from their significant other, make medical decisions for their significant other, take care of the person they love most in the world; gay people do not.  I do not.  I am not equal.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s time I drew a line for my basic sense of self-respect, and sadly for me, that line must be abandoning the state I once considered my home.</p>

I&#8217;ve been hearing a bit about the country &#8220;healing&#8221; after this election &#8212; which is as of right now (Kerry is giving his concession speech), officially over.  &#8220;Re-uniting&#8221; is another term I&#8217;ve heard today.  &#8220;Healing&#8221; and &#8220;re-uniting&#8221; is a big bunch of hokum if you ask me &#8212; this election only shows that the country is terribly split, and either side is going to have a tough battle.  This will be Bush&#8217;s last term, and with a pro-Republican shift in Congress, he&#8217;ll be pushing even more of his conservative legislation through.  The Democrats, long-suffering from the stings of two very, very close defeats will certainly redouble their efforts to curtail those pieces of legislation.  Bush&#8217;s &#8220;standing on principle&#8221; and his black-and-white values did well to retain his base,  despite <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/right.htm" class="External">polls claiming that a majority of Americans think the US is on the wrong track and that the economy is failing</a>.  The gay marriage amendments in 11 states passed by overwhelming margins.  These amendments are &#8220;protection&#8221; amendments &#8212; amendments of exclusion the likes of which we have never seen in this country.  How do people vote for a politician that they feel is putting the country on the wrong track, both economically and politically?    Is the other half of the country so scared that they have to  compromise on their economic and national beliefs that they&#8217;ll elect the guy who will protect them from the gays and the terrorist by standing on prinicpal?  How do you go up against religious faith in a politician?  How do you argue <i>against</i> that sort of bull-headed devotion?   When you&#8217;re against a foe that only knows how to attack and protect, it&#8217;s going to be a hard fight.
</p>
<p>
So, healing isn&#8217;t something that is going to happen &#8212; re-uniting certainly won&#8217;t either.  The gloves are off, if they weren&#8217;t off before.  Get ready.</p>

Well, today is <i>the day</i>.  A quick look at the <a href="../620.html" class="External">Electoral College Projections</a> tells me that the race, as of late yesterday, is quite possibly the tightest it has been all year.  The L.A. Times&#8217; projection shows that there are many states with less than 10% separating the challengers, and if one were to cede the states based on percentage majority, it would come down to a dead heat between Bush and Kerry, with Hawaii as the deciding state (it is completely even according to their polls).  The other three projections in that post also reflect the airtight status of this race.</p>
<p>Last night we received a call from Danny Glover, Ret. General Wesley Clark and Mitch McConnell (we were eating dinner, of course).  In the last week we have received no less than 30 pieces of political mail, a couple of doorknob hangers, and at least a dozen messages on the answering machine.  But after today, I&#8217;ll miss Danny&#8217;s calls.  Yeah, I called him Danny.  When dude calls my house 4 times, I think I reserve the right to call him by his first name, you know.</p>
<p>
Tonight we are having some election day festivities (read: watching Fox News and cackling) and I&#8217;ll be making some <a href="http://soup.allrecipes.com/az/WhiteChiliwithGroundTurkey.asp" class="External">White Turkey Chili</a>.  We have also prepared living arrangements in Canada, just in case :)</p>
<p>
No, not really.  In many ways, I&#8217;ll be sad to see &#8220;the Quadrennial Classic&#8221; go.  I&#8217;m excited about this race &#8212; not so much because I&#8217;m <i>hyped</i> about Kerry, but I&#8217;m hyped that the rest of the U-S-of-A has been whipped into giving a flying foo about the state of the government.  I think we might have a electorate-turnout pot tonight.  I&#8217;m betting on  70%!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you haven&#8217;t voted, get out now.  If you choose not to vote, well then the hell with ya.</p>

First up, the photos from our annual Huber&#8217;s trip have been posted into the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20041016hubers">2004.10.16 Hubers!</a> gallery.  Some great duck photography there, if I do say so myself.

Secondly, before the 2004 DESS Handlaunch competition, Bruce, Brian and I went to see <a href="http://www.theimac.org/richardharker.htm">Richard Harker</a>&#8216;s giant home aquarium.  He built an addition onto his Raleigh, NC home for a 2,000 gallon saltwater reef tank.  It is truly a sight to behold.  You can behold it in the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20041022aquarium">2004.10.22 &#8211; Giant Home Aquarium</a> gallery.</p>
