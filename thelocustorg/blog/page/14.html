Got a call from my younger brother Nick yesterday (which is a little unusual), but he was all excited on the other end of the line, so I figured something was up.  He was at the Best of Louisville awards where his restaurant, <a href="http://www.sevicherestaurant.com/index.html" class="External">Seviche</a> just won a &#8220;Best New Restaurant&#8221; award!  Head chef Anthony Lamas was out-of-town in France, and so Nick (one of two sous chefs) accepted the award from host Terry Meiners.</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve eaten at Seviche a couple of times, and it has always been fantastic, and not just because my lil&#8217; brother is cooking.  It&#8217;s been a long road, but he&#8217;s really stuck with cooking &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of him.  Congrats, Nick!</p></p>

Yesterday, I gave blood for the first time.  I&#8217;m glad I did it, though it certainly knocked me for a loop!  It took me a few hours to &#8220;get right&#8221; again.  For my troubles, though, I did get a snappy &#8220;vintage Red Cross ballcap&#8221;, which I like very much.
</p>
<p>
Haven&#8217;t given blood before?  It&#8217;s really not that bad.  There is a very slight pain when the needle goes in (&#8220;the old familiar sting&#8221; in NIN parlance), but other than that, you lie there and drink some orange juice and squeeze a ball in your hand.  The people running the show in the travelling truck that visited us were very nice.</p>

As previously reported, Kelly and I were on <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/724">The Great Prius Hunt</a>, and as of last night, that hunt came to a satisfying close!
</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/ourprius.jpg" alt="Our Prius" title="Note well the cloud of smug hovering just above" /></p>
<p>
We got a call from Jim Parker over at <a href="http://www.greentreetoyota.com" class="External">GreenTree Toyota</a> to let us know that the car was <i>in</i> and that we could seal the deal that evening.  After a little wait for the financing lady to finish up with some other folks, we signed our lives away, and rolled on out the door.
</p>
<p>
This morning, I put the Prius to the <i>real test</i>, which was this: <i>Can it fit all my sailplane stuff in the rear?</i>.  The answer to that most critical of questions is <i>Yes, and handily</i>.

	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>One package is a charred oaken barren filled with corn squeezins&#8217; and let sit for a decade.  The other is a crude, yet effective attempt at medieval artillery fashioned out of bits and pieces from a local hardware store.  Either is glorious!</p>
<p>It just so happens that I have photo galleriess of both such glories: <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/friends/20060504tasteofoak">2006.05.04 &#8211; Taste of Oak</a> and <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/projects/20060519trebuchets">2006.05.19 &#8211; Trebuchets</a>.</p>
<p><img class="FloatRight" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/16004-4/20060504tasteofoak.jpg" alt="Taste of Oak" /></p>
<p>The &#8220;Taste of Oak&#8221; thing was a fundraiser for the Easter Seals.  Normally held during August, they moved the event to before the Derby (in fact near Oaks Day).  The event involves a bourbon tasting and food from many different vendors, though the bourbon is the main attraction.  Most of the major distilleries in Kentucky show up and are more than happy to give you all the bourbon you want in their custom glassware.  Meanwhile, the Six Million Dollar Man and that Dead Guy From Lost Who Is Related to Tom Cruise wow the audience with their presence.</p>
<p><img class="FloatLeft" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/16043-2/20060519-trebuchets-03-CPAOneCocked.jpg" alt="CPA One" /></p>
<p>The trebuchet (treb-you-shay) thing started I-don&#8217;t-know-when, but suffice it to say any man with sufficient space at one point or another at least <em>considers</em> building a catapult.  Last year, you may remember that some folks from our crue <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/friends/20050704splosions/">built potato guns for the Fourth of July</a>.  This year, we intend to keep up the sciency challenge with the building of catapults out of readily available materials.  Rules and regulations are still in the works, but today (as witnessed by the photos and video) I put my small trebuchet  through it&#8217;s paces with the help of <a class="External" href="http://www.4ourthgate.org">Charlie Dillon</a>.  In the end we semi-reliably flung a golf ball about 60-75 feet.  Glorious!  This small model (named Cheap Plastic Artillery #1, aka CPA One)  will be scaled up into a larger contraption that I have named <em>THE POWER OF LOVE</em></p>

Man, have I been busy as of late!  Let me roll it down to you <i>blog</i> style!
</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/ezbd-docs-DRAFT-cover.jpg" class="FloatRight" /></p>
<p>
First up, since about January, I&#8217;ve been helping out my buddy Denny over at <a href="http://www.polecataero.com">Polecat Aeroplane Works</a> to build the prototype of his new sailplane, the <a href="http://polecatareo.com/products/ezbd" class="External">EZ Bubble Dancer</a>.  You may remember that I <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/662">built something similar last winter</a>, called the <a href="../../soaring/allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a>.  The EZ Bubble Dancer is the &#8220;big brother&#8221; to what I built, with a 117&#8243; wingspan.  Denny saw my <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/soaring/allegro/">Allegro-Lite Building Gallery</a> and offered to let me build the first EZ Bubble Dancer.  I was elated!  It took me a little longer than I had expected, but it was the first kit to be built, so I guess that is expected.  I also volunteered to write the instruction manual, which ended up as a <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/uploads/ezbd/ezbd-docs-DRAFT.pdf" class="External">59-page tome with full color photos</a>.  A lot of work, but well worth it!  Oh, and I also help maintain the <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Polecat Aero website</a> and have been helping out with Denny&#8217;s <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/polecat-challenge-2006" class="External">ginormous handlaunch  contest</a> as well.
</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/midsouth2006flyer.jpg" class="FloatLeft" /></p>
<p>
Even deeper into hobby news, I&#8217;ve been helping to organize and plan the <a href="http://louisvillesoaring.org/content/view/105/43/" class="External">2006 MidSouth Soaring Championships</a> which will be held here in Louisville in late June/early July.  I wrote the <a href="http://louisvillesoaring.org/media/midsouth2006flyer.pdf" class="External">flyer</a> for the contest, and am pretty close to finalizing a t-shirt design.
</p>
<p>
At work we&#8217;ve been pretty busy!  The Interactive Department where I work has seen some changes over the past few months &#8211; and for the good!  Last fall we added <a href="http://x13design.com/bipolar/" class="External">Matt Rasnake</a>, a friend of mine and a fellow ex-Corvus Digital Systems employee.  In the interim between the fall of Corvus and Power, he worked for GE on web stuff. He&#8217;s done right well at Power, and we&#8217;ve certainly had enough to keep him busy.  This spring, we added <a href="http://www.lostinlouisville.com" class="External">Jackson Cooper</a>, another friend of mine and chum from my <a href="http://cbpa.louisville.edu/AcademicPrograms/CIS.htm" class="External">University of Louisville College of Business / Computer Information System</a> days who actually interviewed at Corvus a few times.  He&#8217;s had better luck here at Power and like Matt, is doing very well and staying busy.
</p>
<p>
Me?  Well, apparently last summer I was promoted, and didn&#8217;t know it!  Now, I&#8217;m heading up a team of folks in the Interactive Department and moving into more of a Analyst role while still &#8220;keeping my hands dirty&#8221; in development of websites and such.  I also got to pick my title, which I finally decided was &#8220;Senior Interactive Analyst / Developer&#8221;.  We had a bit of a &#8220;Programmer&#8221; vs. &#8220;Developer&#8221; debate up here, and I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of title &#8220;Programmer&#8221;.  That insinuates that all I do is write line after line of code all day long, which I&#8217;ll tell you is so remote from the truth that it boggles the mind. (Insert your witty puns here, friends).
</p>
<p>
On the fun and fitness end of things, I ran two miles <i>in a row</i> last night and did not collapse.  It actually felt pretty good!  Now, I probably won&#8217;t be trail-running or doing miniMarathons with Kelly any time soon, but it was nice to know that I could run from thugs or bears for a while and at least give them a decent go for it.
</p>
<p>
Finally, on the games front, I&#8217;ve been playing in a poker tournament hosted by colleague and <i>interactive marketing consultant</i> <a href="http://jaylane.com/" class="External">Jay Lane</a> for the past 6 months, one night a month.  I&#8217;ve been fair-to-middling placing as high as 4th out of the 21 people that play each month.  Chuck Pearsall, Hunter Dixon and Chris Gerstle have faired much better (in that order) with Chris being in first place at the moment!  The final tourney is this weekend.  While I don&#8217;t think I have a chance at the money, I hope to ruin someone&#8217;s day!
</p>
<p>
Softball season is also upon us!  Power Softball is in a rebuilding year after a fun year of 1-and-13 ball last year.  The same Jay Lane of poker fame is heading up the team this year after Coach Johnny Kitson has stepped aside to go and get married.  Yes, I know it&#8217;s softball, but dammit I do love anything close to baseball.  Also, I&#8217;m not 28 yet, so I can&#8217;t join up with the <a href="http://www.louisvillemsbl.org/" class="External">Louisville Men&#8217;s Senior Baseball League</a> 28 and Over.</p>

	    <p> Back at work today, which I&#8217;ll admit is a bit of a relief.  Travelling does have it&#8217;s own stresses to be sure.  Thinking about all that work you&#8217;ll have to come back to, not to mention things you&#8217;ve got to put off at home.  Been thinking about <a href="http://www.phparch.com/tek/" class="External">php|tek 2006</a> over the weekend, and I&#8217;ve come up with a few <em>final thoughts</em>.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;ll say that I did learn quite a bit at php|tek, but nothing that I was expecting to learn.  My expectations for this <a href="http://www.php.net" class="External">PHP</a>-centric conference were fairly broad.  I had expected there to be a few very narrow, technical sessions with the majority being broader, more &#8220;this is where we are headed&#8221; type conversations.  I did not expect many non-PHP-specific sessions to do me much of any good.  What I encountered could be construed as <em>completely the opposite</em>.</p>
<p>The majority of the speakers at this conference were those either directly or almost directly related with the day-to-day development of PHP as a programming language.  Many of the speakers were the originators of the stuff they spoke about, or at least had a hand in it.  While this is truly a unique opportunity rarely granted in the IT world &#8212; to get to interact with the person who writes the language which you use each day &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if it is beneficial to most people who come to these conferences.</p>

<p>I wore my &#8220;Microsoft Freedom to Innovate&#8221; t-shirt today.  I consider it the most ironic $10 I&#8217;ve ever spent, and I guess most folks get the joke.  I did get my picture taken with someone with a &#8220;NO SOFTWARE PATENTS&#8221; shirt a lunch, so I consider that a small victory.  His shirt was black, and mine was white.  <em>Nested</em> ironies, I think.  While I&#8217;m on the subject of attire, I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s been shorts and t-shirts for most everyone here, including the presenters.  The &#8220;Schroedinger&#8217;s Cat is Dead&#8221; t-shirt I spied on a certain lass made me chuckle.  The real &#8220;thinking outside the nerd attire box&#8221; award has got to go to Marcus Baker.  I sat in on two of his sessions on two separate days, &#8220;Is Agile Development Right for You?&#8221; and &#8220;Breaking the OO Sound Barrier&#8221;.   Both days he was wearing the same pair of pants.  Big deal, right?  I often wear the same pair of khakis a few days in a row at work.  But Marcus doesn&#8217;t prefer the inconspicuousness of khaki &#8211; he prefers leather.  Leather pants.  Marcus, you have won the con.  Congrats.</p>
<p>All kidding aside, I will say that Marcus&#8217; sessions have been the most enlightening of all that I have attended.  He is a natural and fluid speaker who doesn&#8217;t bombard the audience  with a lot of code or pedantic knowledge.  Granted, his topics haven&#8217;t been &#8220;Migrating from version X to version Y&#8221; or &#8220;The New Features of Some Code Gadget&#8221;, but instead have focused on analysis and design topics that lead to programming strategies.  He does a very good job of it and and while their topics may differ, I think most of the folks I sat in with here at php|tek could take a cue from Marcus.</p>
<p>A certain level of knowledge about PHP is assumed if you are coming to this conference, yes, but I think that level should be fairly low.  Many of the speakers here are actual developers *for* PHP.  This obviously grants them wonderful insight on the depths of the language, but I would rather see more general and real-world applications of PHP.  This is something that Rasmus Lerdorf did very well in his keynote.  Oh &#8211; and before I forget the one session I sat in with Christian Wenz was also very good.</p>
<p>Dan and I took the free Zend Certification Exam this afternoon.   I don&#8217;t know how well I did, and honestly I&#8217;m not that concerned having taken it.  Many of the questions dealt with detailed specifics of the language and it&#8217;s constructs, which is something that I normally let the webserver worry about.  I have bigger things to consider and remember when I use PHP.  A certification is only a nice thing to put on your wall, I think.  Programming&#8217;s name belies it&#8217;s complexity &#8211; a complexity that supercedes the language itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;PHP Pool Party&#8221; later tonight with an open bar!  More later?</p>

	    <p>Some say that the second Internet bubble is upon us.  I think they might just be right, based on the amount and complexity of work that has been coming in to us at work.  This time, however, it&#8217;s considerably more<br />
robust and &#8220;pop-proof&#8221; (or at least we all hope so).  The ideas that inflated the first bubble seem to have<br />
risen from the ashes of that first wave.  The idea of the Internet as Desktop and Desktop as Internet.<br />
The dreamy &#8220;thin client&#8221; that was going to be everywhere, cheaply and clawing its way onto your TV, into your<br />
car and on the front of your refrigerator.  Rockets on your shoes and teleporters and the whole thing, too.</p>
<p>So maybe it&#8217;s apt that I&#8217;m here in Orlando, so close to Kennedy Space Center where, back in the 1960s, we<br />
actually did make the impossible possible without an implosion.  Lives aren&#8217;t on the line in the Internet,<br />
and so such irrational exuberance can lead to such things.  The hype was believed back then, but now the<br />
people behind the scenes are wiser for the experience.  There were so many great, grand ideas in the late<br />
90&#8242;s, but so little consideration and so much money doesn&#8217;t fly in the world of the Internet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, things have settled down on the Internet.  The browser wars have gone from hot to cold, and<br />
the medium that is the Internet is a little more predictable with fewer outliers.  This has allowed companies<br />
like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft (and a thousand smaller joints) to create applications for all people, all<br />
browsers, all platforms that *work* and bring a little of the promise of the grand ideas of the late 90&#8242;s.</p>
<p>Gmail, Google Maps, Flickr, digg.com, etc. all make use of these grand ideas, like /your data on the web/ and<br />
/the web as read/write/ and the web as a moving, usable and up-to-date desktop application.  The technologies<br />
behind these are various and sundry (mostly sundry), but focus primarily on the easy exchange of easily<br />
readable data.  Things like map info, stock information, search results, whatever.  Make that information easily<br />
available and portable and great things happen.</p>
<p>The reason why I am here at php|tek 2006 is specifically for PHP, but a lot of the content so far has centered<br />
around that overarching idea of what I was just musing about.  The &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243;, the &#8220;next generation&#8221;, whatever<br />
you&#8217;d like to call it.  How does PHP fit in there?  How is it changing to fit in?  Knowing just where the<br />
tech on the web is heading is truly the only way to know what is going on in PHP.</p>
<p>PHP is one of the most widely-used, profilic and advanced technologies used on the web.  Rasmus Lerdorf started<br />
PHP back in 1995 and has been instrumental in it&#8217;s development ever since.  He now works for Yahoo!, and seems to<br />
be focused on these emerging Internet technologies.  Suffice it to say, he remains very much a &#8220;blue-collar&#8221; guy<br />
who created and directs the development of a technology that has affected so much of the &#8220;white-collar&#8221; world.</p>
<p>Rasmus&#8217; keynote speech earlier this morning was considerably less &#8220;high-level&#8221; than I had expected.  This is what I have come to expect from the open-source world.  The people who are making the changes and pushing things forward still have their hands dirty in the real world.  However, those people who are truly successful are the odd ones who can do so and still keep a grip on the big picture.  I get the feeling the Rasmus is one of those<br />
people. He, in his hour-long keynote presentation (I wouldn&#8217;t call it a speech), explained by example and in code the pitfalls of the new-school web apps, and how to mitigate those pitfalls.  He also showcased how PHP can simply and easily be integrated into these &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; apps.  An interesting blend of real-world considerations, code and examples that underscored how important is the inter-relation between technologies.</p>
<p>An unusual keynote, for sure.  Part of me was hoping for more of a &#8220;state of PHP&#8221; sort of address, but much like any good programmer, you leave that stuff for the brass, and get down to nitty-gritty with the troops.  I&#8217;m sitting here in shorts, a t-shirt and flip-flops, so what else should I expect?  More later!</p>

<p>The promised free WiFi access didn&#8217;t materialize until about 3 PM here after a fandango of new access points and provider snafus.  Probably a good thing, though, as it allowed the small cadre of geeks who showed up to this con a day early to focus on the &#8220;In-Depth Seminars&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fluidmind.org" class="External">Dan</a> and I chose the &#8220;Master OOP in PHP 5&#8243; talk hosted by <a href="http://marcus-boerger.de/" class="External">Marcus Boerger</a>, one of the architects of the PHP 5 object-oriented code.  Marcus, who lives in Germany, offered up a very straightforward, detailed talks spikedwith a wry sense of humor that pops up when you least expect it.  PHP 5 introduces a &#8220;revamp&#8221; (a term Marcus didn&#8217;t care for) of the OO system in PHP, and pushes it more in the direction of what passes for a standard in the OO world.  Better privacy control, extensibility and overall greater functionality.  A very worthwhile talk and very much on the bleeding edge of the PHP world.</p>
<p>The next talk was &#8220;PHP &amp; AJAX: A winning combination&#8221; with <a href="http://coggeshall.org/" class="External">John Coggeshall</a>, a very outspoken and enthusiastic guy who works with <a href="http://www.oreilly.net" class="External">O&#8217;Reilly</a> (the publisher of many a great book on technology) and Zend (the engine behind PHP).  AJAX is one of those buzzwords in the industry right now like &#8220;LAMP&#8221; (<a href="http://linux.org" class="External">Linux</a> <a href="http://www.apache.org" class="External">Apache</a> <a href="http://www.mysql.org" class="External">MySQL</a> <a href="http://www.php.net" class="External">PHP</a>) and &#8220;podcast&#8221;, which aren&#8217;t anything new (see earlier post <a href="../672.html">on podcasting</a>) but now have a name people can talk about.  AJAX is Javascript (the duct tape of the Internet) and XML (sorta) that powers things like <a href="http://maps.google.com" class="External">Google Maps</a> and <a href="http://www.gmail.com" class="External">GMail</a>.  Very whiz-bang stuff that brings the web interface a little closer to being what you might expect on the desktop.  John spoke a lot about what is wrong with AJAX, and suprisingly little about what PHP can offer it.  He didn&#8217;t really tell Dan or I anything we didn&#8217;t know about AJAX, but in a roundabout way inform everyone that AJAX is still very new and fraught with problems.    AJAX apps may seem simple on the web, but behind the scenes there are some very touch problems borne from the challenge of making computers interface with humans a little bit better.  From that and the little PHP content, I gather that even PHP doesn&#8217;t really know what to do with AJAX until it matures a little.</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/spacemonkey.jpg" class="FloatRight" /></p>
<p>John wrapped up around 3PM, which luckily allowed Dan and I enough time to beat a path eastward to the <a href="http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/" class="External">Kennedy Space Center</a>.  I&#8217;m a sucker for anything involving space, so this was a welcome and awesome side-trip.  Kennedy Space Center sits out on a island off the Florida coast and our rented <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius" class="External">Toyota Prius</a> got us there quickly, quietly and burning little gas.</p>

	    <p> Hola muchachos!  I&#8217;m here in Orlando this week for the <a href="http://www.phparchitect.com" class="External">php|architect</a> <a href="http://www.phparchitect.com/tek" class="External">php|tek</a> conference.  <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is the programming language that powers this site, and I have the opportunity (thanks to <a href="http://www.powercreative.com" class="External">work</a>) to attend this year.  The keynote speaker is <a href="http://lerdorf.com/bio.php" class="External">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> the guy who started PHP, so I&#8217;m pretty hyped.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this for a programming language?&#8221; you say!  Why, sure, yes.  PHP is one of the best languages for creating dynamic web (and otherwise) content, and I have used it to create things such as <a href="../../projects/phpfeed.html">phpfeed</a> and <a href="https://thelocust.org/projects/instantrss">instantRSS</a>, both which enjoy(ed) moderate success and allowed me to further my knowledge of the language.  Not to mention <a href="../../index.html">this site</a>, <a href="http://www.louisvillesoaring.org" class="External">LouisvilleSoaring.org</a> among many other sites with which I have been involved.</p>
<p>So, all ye nerds, stay tuned.  I&#8217;m staying at the <a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/MCOAP" class="External">Marriot Airport Orlando</a>, and   I should be blogging throughout the week-long conference, as  php|tek has graciously offered up a WiFi access point for our usage.</p>
