<p>    we played a <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/08182002-baseball">great game of baseball</a> today, too!  21-20 the final score, in our first ever 9-inning game!  it was awesome.  we also had three (3) new people show up.  Well, 4 if you count Jackson, but he&#8217;d played with us before.  But you haven&#8217;t seen him &#8212; so he&#8217;s new to you!</p>
<p>    Also, there are a couple of other galleries up.  Nothing to wacky, just some <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/08102002-charades">charades</a> and <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/07212002-besuboru">a shot</a> from a Bats game.</p>

<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7674-2/05050005_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Got up bright and early at the crack of a continental breakfast in a<br />
converted gymnasium.  That hotel was just weird, and filled with<br />
children.  We let out of that joint, and stalked the &#8220;World Market&#8221; for<br />
interesting stuff.  We found a big bamboo shade we had been looking for<br />
cheap.  Threw it in the car, and made our way to Busch Stadium to see the<br />
St. Louis Cardinals vs. the Atlanta Braves.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020505honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7672-2/05050004_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Paid $6 for parking, about 2 blocks from the stadium &#8212; which i can deal<br />
with.  We showed up about 2 hours early, and the place was packed!  It<br />
turns out the gates open 2 hours prior (1:10 being the game start).  We<br />
watched some batting practice after we got our tickets, and just chilled.<br />
Kelly and I downed a beer and pretzel to start things off.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020505honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7688-2/05050012_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Bud Light is like water.  It&#8217;s evil, really.  Also, it&#8217;s not good beer.<br />
But it&#8217;s definitely potable. The game was a great time, but the<br />
Cardinal&#8217;s fielding wasn&#8217;t exactly stellar.  And the pitching wasn&#8217;t all<br />
that great.  I respect Darryl Kile, but he got behind pretty fast (no<br />
thanks to the fielding of his own team).  Luckily, this made for a good<br />
end-game, with the Cardinals making a small rally from the 4-0 deficit<br />
they had dug.  They lost 4-2, though.</p>
<p>We bid fond farewell to Busch Stadium &#8212; i enjoyed it greatly.  The park<br />
is nice, easy to get to and, perhaps more importantly, easy to get out<br />
of.  The ballgame was great fun, and the crowd there was a good time.</p>
<p>We hopped on 64 Eastbound, and as the Arch faded from our rear-view<br />
mirror, Kelly and I both felt a little sad.  Our journey in the west had<br />
officially come to a close, as we passed back through the gateway to the<br />
west.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020505honeymoon"><br />

</a></p>
<p>However, our adventures were not to end just quite yet.  We still had<br />
&#8220;Albino Squirrel Hunt #2&#8243; to go &#8212; Olney, IL.  About an hour and a half<br />
drive down US150, we get to Olney, where a sign greets us saying &#8220;Home of<br />
the White Squirrels&#8221;.  Note: not &#8220;albino&#8221; but &#8220;white&#8221;.  Maybe this is a<br />
technical distinction &#8212; maybe they are just WHITE, and not &#8220;albino&#8221;.<br />
Though, i think they are technically &#8220;albino&#8221;, but i never got close<br />
enough to actually check out the eyes and other albinism-affected<br />
features.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020505honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7698-2/05050017_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>We stopped at a great little Mexican restaurant called &#8220;El Rancherito&#8221;,<br />
escaped for under $20, and went a&#8217;huntin!  We drove about, searching the<br />
&#8220;suburbian&#8221; areas of Olney (a small area) for a while, noting that many<br />
of the squirrels we were seeing were in fact WHITE, but they were all<br />
fake.  As we rounded a corner into another neighborhood, we struck WHITE<br />
GOLD!  A white squirrel chasing, and possibly harassing, MAYBE EVEN<br />
belittling a &#8220;normal&#8221; fox squirrel.  Kelly and I snap photos as they seem<br />
to pose for our peering lenses.  They even pose ON THE TREE &#8212; but then,<br />
as quickly as we had noticed them, the squirrels do that squirrely thing<br />
they do, and escape around to the other side of the trees.  One down, how<br />
many to go, i wonder?!</p>
<p>We search as the summery day fades, noting yet more squirrel-themed yard<br />
ornaments, and a bunch of white STUFF in the yards that fool us for mere<br />
moments (bags, cups, foam, etc).  We snap some photos of various Olney<br />
squirrel-related stuff, and the post office and police office for good<br />
measure.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020505honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7710-2/05050024_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>I must say, as far as style goes, Olney, IL has Marionville, MO beat.<br />
Marionville is a Podunk, whereas Olney is more towards Mayberry.  They<br />
had nice little town centers and stuff.  Also, the ratio of normal to<br />
albino squirrels (based on our cursory 30 minute searches) for both Olney<br />
and Marionville was 1 to 1! In Olney, we saw two (real) squirrels &#8212; one<br />
white, one &#8220;normal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ahhh well.</p>
<p>We took US150 back to I64, passing through Paoli, IN and Palmyra, IN.<br />
It was nice to see Louisville&#8217;s skyline again, and home felt real<br />
comfortable.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020505honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7720-2/05050029_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>I plan on making a directory and map and such for the places we visited<br />
in the near future.  As for now, I&#8217;m tired as heck!  Hope you all have<br />
enjoyed these travelogues!</p>

    </div><!--/head-->
	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>
After visiting the Hays, KS Wal-Mart (perdon &#8212; it was the SUPER WalMart<br />
FoodCenter), we headed back on I70 towards Topeka, Kansas City, and St.<br />
Louis.  </p>
<p>I had looked up Kansas on <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com" class="External">Roadside America</a>, and found that<br />
two stops on our route, Salina and Junction City both had some sites in<br />
them.  I slept through the Salina attraction &#8212; which is the &#8220;Bones of<br />
Seymour&#8221; &#8212; an elephant that went on a rampage from circus in 1920, and<br />
was killed after being shot with 15 doses of poison and 15 steel-tipped<br />
bullets.  Oh well.  Junction City had an &#8220;Atomic Cannon&#8221; &#8212; which was a<br />
short-lived weapon made by the gubment during the cold war &#8212; it could lob<br />
a tactical atomic weapon 7 miles.  The prototype was only fired once,<br />
thankfully.  However, in my infinite wisdom, I didn&#8217;t get detailed<br />
directions to the site of the Atomic Cannon, and we couldn&#8217;t find it.<br />
However, there was yet another Air Force Base, which Kelly and I didn&#8217;t<br />
really want to go on &#8212; i think the atomic cannon lay behind its walls.<br />
At least i was within a couple of miles of an Atomic Cannon.
</p>
<p>On through Topeka and Kansas City.  Outside of Kansas City, we stopped<br />
into a Chinese buffet.  It sucked.  Bad.  Louisville is blessed quality<br />
ethnic restaurants.  We also have our share of crappy ones, sure, but they<br />
are outweighed by the good ones, at least.</p>
<p>Back on the road, between Kansas City and St. Louis, we were travelling<br />
about 80 MPH when we were all of the sudden passed on the left (in the<br />
emergency lane) by some nutball.  He continued on down the road, braking<br />
erradically and swerving and what-not.  He seemed to be a little<br />
intoxicated &#8212; okay, he was sloshed.  I called 911, reported it, and they<br />
said that they would do something about him.  About 15 miles past that, we<br />
saw him on the the side of the road &#8212; RELIEVING HIMSELF, IN FULL VIEW OF<br />
THE PASSING TRAFFIC.  Hilarity.  We stopped for gas and to relieve<br />
ourselves (i told kelly that apparently it&#8217;s OK to do it on the side of<br />
the road, but she objected), and headed on &#8212; wondering what happened to<br />
our guy.  Another 15 miles down the road, we see him again &#8212; sitting in<br />
the back of a police cruiser.  Hah!  Dumbass.</p>
<p>We tried to stay at the same Comfort Inn we stayed at during our last stay<br />
in St. Louis, but they were all booked up &#8212; so we are staying in a Days<br />
Inn with a pool and game room and all.  Lots of kids here, and a little<br />
more expensive than the Comfort Inn, but oh well &#8212; we are shaving a<br />
couple of days off our trip already.</p>
<p>We checked in, swam, and then headed towards Nacho Mama&#8217;s &#8212; the<br />
restaurant we tried to eat at last Sunday, but they were closed.  They<br />
were open today, though!  It&#8217;s a cool little fast-food tex-mex joint.<br />
Kelly had some tasty Portobello Quesadillas, and i had their taco platter.<br />
The salsa was roasted and sublime!  The nachos and guacamole tasty as<br />
well&#8230;  Down the road was &#8220;Hacienda&#8221; and they were throwing a HUGE Cinco<br />
De Mayo celebration.  Lots of drunken thirtysomethings there.
</p>
<p>We are going to a St. Louis Cardinals game tomorrow, and then off to home.<br />
Yay!  I love baseball, and this is only my second MLB game.  We ordered<br />
tickets in 10 minutes, too.  Yay Internet!  </p>
<p>We have a good internet connection this time, so i&#8217;ve uploaded pics from<br />
Tuesday and Wednesday (Albuquerque and Tusayan, AZ). </p>
<p>All of this travelling has been quite fun so far.  But it&#8217;s starting to<br />
blend together, because we have done SO much and travelled so far.  It&#8217;s<br />
like Ozzy Osborne on tour &#8212; i have to have the name of the city i&#8217;m in<br />
written on my hand!  No, not really, but close enough.</p>
<p>Tomorrow &#8212; World Market (that cool Pier-One-Done-Right store, the<br />
baseball game, Olney Albino Squirrel Hunt #2, and then home!)</p>

	    <h2>Alamosa, CO and all points east</h2>
<p>We just let out of Alamosa, CO, heading east on US160 towards a town that<br />
starts with a &#8220;W&#8221; but neither kelly nor i can keep it in our mind.<br />
Welhausen?  Weyerhausen?  I don&#8217;t remember.  Oh well, from there, up I25<br />
to Pueblo/Colorado Springs, then US24 to I70 and on through Kansas.<br />
Hopefully, we can make it to Kansas City, Missouri today. It&#8217;s possible,<br />
but not real likely.</p>
<p>Outside of Alamosa in an interesting mix of plains and mountains.  The<br />
mountains rise gracefully from the edge of the plains, soaring into the<br />
sky.  Many of the snow-capped peaks we see here at 13000-14000 feet high.<br />
We currently sit at about 7000 ft.  It&#8217;s great to look out the window and<br />
see huge mountains.  </p>
<p>We just passed through Walsenberg (not Weyerhausen), and are on our way<br />
north on I25 towards Pueblo and Colorado Springs.  The flatness of Kansas<br />
is starting to creep in a bit, i fear.  Kelly mentioned that she almost<br />
didn&#8217;t want to get on I25, because US160 was such a nice, scenic drive.<br />
We haven&#8217;t been on an Interstate since Flagstaff, and I guess we&#8217;ve been<br />
spoiled.  Well, if we didn&#8217;t take I25 to I70, we&#8217;d never get home.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We finally made it to Limon, CO, and got on I-70 towards Kansas!  About<br />
100 miles out, we saw a &#8220;Point of Interest&#8221; sign &#8212; and saw some weird<br />
tower up on the side of the highway.  Looks interesting&#8230;. pulling up, we<br />
see that it&#8217;s the &#8220;Wonder View Tower&#8221; &#8212; see six states from the top!<br />
Huh.  This tower isn&#8217;t THAT tall, but we walk inside the crampt store to<br />
find an old man by the name of Jerry Chubbuck.  The store is crammed from<br />
walls to ceiling with various old relics &#8212; bottles, blowtorches, rocks,<br />
gemstones, t-shirts, EVERYTHING.  The ceiling even has stuff hanging from<br />
it. </p>
<p>A note: words cannot completely describe the Wonder View Tower in Genoa,<br />
Colorado.  Words and sight may not do it justice.  All senses are<br />
assaulted.  </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020503honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7574-2/05030002_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>The old man tells us that it&#8217;s a $1 for admission &#8212; and we&#8217;ll get our<br />
dollar back if we can guess what the uses of various &#8220;mystery items&#8221; are.<br />
He produces two metal mesh basket-looking things, and Kelly guesses a<br />
collander, and I said it was a cheese strainer.  His faces lights up with<br />
the guesses &#8212; he mentions that some people think &#8220;hat&#8221;, others think &#8220;bra<br />
cup for Dolly Parton&#8221; (to which he places them both to his chest, and<br />
dances about a bit).  I am COMPLETELY mesmerized by this old guy.  Turns<br />
out, they are muzzles for horses, so they don&#8217;t eat the corn whilst<br />
harvesting.  He leads us to an old glass case crammed with random stuff.<br />
The first &#8220;mystery item&#8221; is a a strange cutting device &#8212; or thats what it<br />
seems like.  Imagine a garlic press &#8212; but with a blade on it.  I think<br />
&#8220;umbilical cord serverer&#8221;.  He mentions one woman thought it was a<br />
pill-cutter.  He produces a box with instructions for this device on the<br />
back &#8212; it turns out it is a chicken killer!  Place the blade in the<br />
mouth, and the flat part on the skull.  Pop!  Brain-b-gone.  He produces<br />
some stones that turn out to be a dinosaur gizzard stone, and some<br />
dino-dook.  A &#8220;cow-pill&#8221; magnet that is fed to a cow to get the various<br />
metal objects in a cow stomach out (&#8220;it&#8217;s been used three times, pulled<br />
out of three piles &#8212; but only cleaned once!&#8221; he exclaims), is the next<br />
item.  Also included &#8212; a rubber core from a 1910&#8242;s car wheel.  </p>

<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7576-2/05030003_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>So, quickly the amusement of the tower has been severly downgraded &#8211;<br />
looking at all the stuff on the walls, in the twenty-two rooms of this old<br />
house could take years.  Now, this used to be a stop on US24, a highway<br />
that used to pass by it (which was replaced with I70).  I70 ran around the<br />
back of this used-to-be restaurant, nightclub, museum, curio shop.  So,<br />
after US24 dried up (it&#8217;s still there), Jerry Chubbuck, who knew the<br />
original owner as a kid, renovated the place out the back.  Now, it is his<br />
own private museum and antique shop.  </p>
<p>A little background on Jerry Chubbuck &#8212; he&#8217;s described in one of the many<br />
articles on the walls as an &#8220;amateur archaeologist&#8221;.  In 1957, he<br />
discovered a huge triceratops skeleton near Kit Carson, CO, also an 8500<br />
year old bison kill near the same place.  The triceratops &#8212; or part of it<br />
&#8211; now lies in one corner of the front room of the old house.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020503honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7578-3/05030004_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Jerry&#8217;s enthusiasm about every little piece of the place is contagious.<br />
Kelly likened it to a young child wanting you to play with his toys &#8212; and<br />
Jerry has them in spades.  Take, for instance, his bottle collection.  In<br />
the span of 15 minutes talking bottles with him, I received an education<br />
that I will never forget.  I now know how to accurately age a bottle &#8211;<br />
it&#8217;s all in the seams.  Single-seam bottles date from 1915 on.<br />
Multi-seamed bottles from 1875 on.  Things earlier than that are<br />
&#8220;tri-molded&#8221;, and seamless.  He pulled out some amazing bottles, and I was<br />
enraptured with each.  It was amazing.  </p>
<p>Having a conversation with Jerry is interesting.  He ends most sentences<br />
with &#8220;thats for sure&#8221;, &#8220;ain&#8217;t that right&#8221;, or &#8220;dontchu know it&#8221;.  It&#8217;s<br />
almost like he wants to show the entire museum to you in the span of your<br />
stay.  Frankly, I could&#8217;ve stayed for days &#8212; weeks even with the stuff he<br />
has there.  WWI helmets with bullet holes, Civil War era telegraph keys,<br />
early blowtorches, two-headed calves, bizarre medical implements, rocks<br />
and rocks and rocks.  Old books stacked floor to ceiling, 20,000 indian<br />
artifacts, unused bars of soap, barbed-wire, and bottles.  So many<br />
bottles.  Bottles from 18th century London, 19th century booze and pop<br />
bottles.  </p>
<p>One half of the museum has 10 rooms and the tower, the other half (which<br />
used to serve as the kitchen, the dance-hall, the stage, and the<br />
restaurant).  While you are looking around, Jerry will often stick his<br />
head around the corner, urging to you to &#8220;come look&#8221;.  There are so many<br />
things, and Jerry knows a story about them all.  One of which was a 200<br />
(or so) year old ceremonial chair from China, which used to have jade<br />
stones inlaid &#8212; which had been removed and replaced with marbles. </p>
<p>The great thing about Wonder View Tower is that Jerry makes the museum<br />
what it is, and Jerry wouldn&#8217;t be there if it wasn&#8217;t for Wonder View being<br />
built back in the 1880&#8242;s.  The history behind the store is compounded by<br />
what it is today.  I can only imagine what it was like back in the 1930s,<br />
when the founder of the place, C.W. Gregory would stand on the top of the<br />
tower and greet the oncoming motorists via a loudspeaker.  They would stop<br />
over for lunch, or the for the night, and enjoy the view and the live<br />
music.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Finally about the tower &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty tall, and according to an alleged<br />
1934 Geological Survey report, it is the tallest point between Denver and<br />
New York.  something which I could believe, as it stands at 5000 something<br />
feet above sea level.  Also, Ripley&#8217;s Believe It Or Not proved that is was<br />
possible to see six states from the tower.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Wonder View Tower is the perfect side-of-the-road site.  Lots of<br />
history, lots of fun, and a curator that is like a whirlwind of generosity<br />
and knowledge.  I was sad to leave it really, but as we exited the museum<br />
with t-shirts in hand, Jerry ran outside, wanting to get our pictures<br />
taken with some guns and hats he had stowed away.  He snapped our fotos,<br />
and then ran back inside to grab the other two visitors, to have them snap<br />
the photo.  He returned with the other visitors and &#8212; get this &#8212; a<br />
monster mask and a big spear.  They took our photos, we shook hands, and<br />
regrettably headed out on the road.  </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020503honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7632-2/05030031_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>By the way, outside, there were two old junked cars, a Ford Fairline 500<br />
and a Cadillac, FILLED WITH BOTTLES.  Bottles on top of bottles.  Also, a<br />
junked modern import.  Later, Wonder View!</p>
<p>Wow.  I don&#8217;t know if anything will top that, really &#8212; and to think, we<br />
weren&#8217;t originally going to pass through there. I&#8217;m so glad we did.  </p>
<p>About 75 miles outside of Hays, KS we started seeing signs for the &#8220;Worlds<br />
Largest Prairie Dog &#8212; 8000 lbs!&#8221;.  Well, eventually we got off the I70,<br />
and turned into &#8220;Prairie Dog Town&#8221; &#8212; which is now a Prairie Dog Ghost<br />
Town.  Oh well.  </p>
<p>We pulled into Hays, KS with the gas gauge on E &#8212; we made 320 miles on a<br />
10 gallon tank.  Pretty good.  We found that there was a local theatre<br />
showing SpiderMan, and after we checked into the Super 8 motel where we<br />
are now staying, we caught some dinner, and then went to see the 9:30<br />
show.</p>
<p>Well, if the previews were any indication, this movie was going to rock.<br />
Star Wars Episode 2 &#8212; HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.  I don&#8217;t think i&#8217;d seen the<br />
trailer they had shown.  Action, action, action.  Sooooo good.  The Men In<br />
Black II trailer was equally as kickin.  I can&#8217;t wait to see a good fun<br />
summer movie.  Even the Minority Report trailer looks really good!<br />
Spielberg can be a little saccharin for me, but this seems to be something<br />
that won&#8217;t be quite as much.  AI was almost too sweet.  Needs more<br />
&#8216;splosions! </p>
<p>Well, anyway, Spiderman rocked the house.  I had worried that it would be<br />
too corny, as Stan Lee titles can be sometimes, but I think the script and<br />
directing made this sufficiently dark.  Spiderman comes across as a more<br />
and more dark and conflicted personality.  Sure, the depth of that isn&#8217;t<br />
MILES deep, but for a 2 hour movie, it did the job well.  Also, the<br />
casting was excellent, I thought.  Many slighted Tobey Maguire for being<br />
sleepy and stoic, but it fit the writing so well.  Maguires portrayal at<br />
times IS a little sleepy, but the stoicism and introversion that comes<br />
with &#8220;super powers&#8221; is there.  The story line isn&#8217;t the big happy Superman<br />
boy does good line that one may expect.  I&#8217;m so happy that talent and good<br />
writing are finally coming behind the stories that have been so popular<br />
with so many people over the years.  Sure, the costumes can be a little<br />
hokey at times (which is dealt with greatly in this movie), but you can<br />
suspend your belief a bit.  Willem Dafoe played the Green Goblin<br />
excellently, and thankfully, they didn&#8217;t portray him as they did in the<br />
comics I read when I was younger.  Obviously, it&#8217;s updated, but he isn&#8217;t<br />
quite as, um, cartoonish and elf-like.  </p>
<p>Now, i have to mention the following:  Ben Parker tells Peter &#8220;With great<br />
power comes great responsibility&#8221;.  This is a good theme in the movie &#8211;<br />
but replace &#8220;great&#8221; with &#8220;super&#8221;, and imagine Thomas Haden Church saying<br />
those words &#8212; THATS RIGHT.  The Strobe, from the Specials.  Just<br />
remember: WITH SUPER POWERS COMES SUPER RESPONSIBILITY, DAMMIT.</p>
<p>Heh.  All together, a great, great movie.  It has a great feeling about<br />
it.  It&#8217;s not too corny, but not too dark.  It&#8217;s a good, fun, well<br />
directed (Sam Raimi of Evil Dead fame), FUN movie.  Fun fun fun.  Also, it<br />
sets up a sequel quite well, and for the fans of comicland Spidey, it<br />
sticks well to the title.  </p>
<p>A note from Kelly: Kirsten Dunst had great shoes.  Kelly gives extra-soopa<br />
props to the costume designer.  &#8220;Especially the camel-butterscotch<br />
slingbacks in the wet-Mary-Jane upside-down kissy scene&#8221;.  I have to<br />
admit, i wasn&#8217;t so looking at the shoes in that scene &#8212; YOWZA!
<p>Well, it&#8217;s nearly 2AM CST here, so I&#8217;m going to go to sleep &#8212; gonna go<br />
back to St. Louis tomorrow, hopefully in town by Sunday (3 days early!) </p>
<p>Other addenda:  There is a restaurant in Ellis (i think that is the name<br />
of the town) called Big Wong&#8217;s.  *snicker* </p>

	    <h2>somewhere past Mexican Water, AZ on US160 heading towards Four Corners</h2>
<p>Got up at the crack o&#8217; dawn this morning (5 AM, 8AM EST) to go to the<br />
Canyon.  We let out of the hotel, and hit the McDonalds across the street.<br />
Everything is a little more expensive here.  We downed some bad coffee,<br />
and headed to the Canyon.  Might I say that it was COLD this morning.  So<br />
cold you could see your breath.  However, within 1/2 an hour of being at<br />
the Canyon, it warmed up considerably.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7264-3/05020022_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>The Canyon is mind-bogglingly huge. I&#8217;ve don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been able<br />
to look 5 miles in one direction and see something.  There is a spire of<br />
rock on the South side of the Canyon called the &#8220;Temple of Isis&#8221;, and as<br />
the crow flies, it&#8217;s 5 miles from the Yavapai Point Lookout.  Crazy.  I<br />
can only think that that would be huge.  It is impossible to get a<br />
relative sense of scale out here.  You can see the river, but telling how<br />
wide it is not possible.  I assume that from where we saw it, it was about<br />
500 feet wide, but it could&#8217;ve been only 50 or 1500.  We checked out a<br />
number of lookouts &#8212; Yavapai Point, Mather Point, Grandview, Moran,<br />
Lipan, and Desert View points.  All stunning in their own rights.  Very<br />
few people out this morning, too, which made it very quiet.
</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7336-2/05020059_G.jpg" class="FloatLeft" alt="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>
Desert View is neat because there is a 40 foot tall &#8220;lighthouse&#8221; structure<br />
there, with a winding staircase and all.  The view is spectacular, and<br />
it&#8217;s only $.25 to go up.  That edge of the canyon stands at 7500ft above<br />
sea level, and going up the stairs put a hurting on Kelly and I both.<br />
Muscles aching, lungs heaving.  There were quite a few internationals<br />
there, but mostly the French.  Now, this isn&#8217;t a generalization about the<br />
French, but tey all smelled like Karl Lagerfeld had thrown up on them.<br />
Wow.  Do they bathe in that stuff?  Shoo&#8230;. stink-ay!
</p>

</a></p>
<p>As we were walking out, we happened to be passed by some saffron-cloaked<br />
Buddhist monks, which shuffled past in their yoda-like gaits.  We snapped<br />
some pictures &#8212; Kelly wondered if it was okay to do so &#8212; I said yes, but<br />
as long as you don&#8217;t attempt to feed or approach them, just like the pair<br />
of Mule deer we saw earlier in the morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7423-2/05020102_G.jpg" class="FloatLeft" alt="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Considering that there were no guided tours that day, and that the &#8220;easy&#8221;<br />
trails that don&#8217;t require good stiff boots or crampons (boot spikes) were<br />
on the other side of the Canyon, Kelly and I got our eyeful of the giant<br />
hole in the ground, and we split for Tuba City.  </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />

</a></p>
<p>Between the Canyon and the intersection of US64 and US160, there are<br />
&#8220;Navajo Markets&#8221;.  Literally one every mile or so, usually coinciding with<br />
&#8220;Scenic Views&#8221;.  Each of these &#8220;Indian Markets&#8221; has plenty of stuff in<br />
them, but frankly, once you&#8217;ve seen one Kokopelli, you&#8217;ve seen them all.<br />
The day when I say &#8220;wow, that&#8217;s in interesting interpretation of a<br />
Kokopelli&#8221; will be&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what it will be, but I doubt that day<br />
will come.  Anywho, we stopped at two of these markets, browsed a bit, but<br />
the spectacular things were the views there.  Most of them had HUGE<br />
canyons behinds them.  Spectacular canyons, that somehow looked all the<br />
more impressive because you COULD get a sense of scale.  That, and the<br />
cliffs there were even more forbidding.  Many pictures were taken.
</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7478-3/05020128_G.jpg" class="FloatLeft" alt="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Speaking of cliffs, there was an interesting book at the Desert View<br />
Lookout that details each and every known death-by-falling at the Canyon.<br />
Recent up until November of 2001, where a woman backing up to take a<br />
picture fell 847 feet to her death.  Oddly enough, the whole event was<br />
photographed.  Lots of people fall, apparently.  As the sign pointed out<br />
&#8220;most&#8221; happened when people hopped fences.  Don&#8217;t hop the fences, folks &#8211;<br />
you&#8217;ll end up in the book.</p>

<p>Driving up to Tuba City on US89, you pass through the Painted Desert. It<br />
is rather beautiful.  The various strata of rock are colored from pink to<br />
blue to gray, and even the clouds seem to take on a bit of that<br />
coloration.  After taking US160 West, we hit Kayenta, AZ, a small town,<br />
but it has a movie theatre, so it can&#8217;t be all that bad.  I had heard<br />
about a Burger King here that has an exhibit on Navajo &#8220;Code Talkers&#8221; &#8212; a<br />
band of Navajo utilized during WWII to act as encryption devices in the<br />
Pacific theatre.  They weren&#8217;t used in the European theatre, and I really<br />
don&#8217;t know why.  They are widely credited with winning the hard-fought<br />
battle of Iwo Jima, as they were able to communicated freely and securely,<br />
leaving the Japanese baffled.  Now, while this is quite heroic and all &#8211;<br />
they were to be shot if they even *might* be captured by the Japanese.<br />
That&#8217;s what this Nicolas Cage movie &#8220;Windtalkers&#8221; is all about &#8212; i&#8217;ll<br />
probably see it.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the exhibit was pretty small, with a lot of interesting doo-dads<br />
from the war, like guns, sidearms, and &#8220;wolf cards&#8221; &#8212; essentially nudie<br />
card decks.  A couple of articles on the Navajo servicemen were plastered<br />
on the walls.  </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7482-3/05020130_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /></a></p>
<p>We ate outside, as it was nice, and we noticed there were quite a few<br />
stray dogs around, some in pretty bad shape.  It was sad, really, but they<br />
mostly kept their distance, and stayed in the shade.</p>
<p>Back on the road after lunch, we stopped at Four Corners, USA.  Four<br />
Corners is the only point common to four states in the United States.<br />
Thanks to manifest destiny, most of the western US was carved up in<br />
rectangular chunks.  Thanks to this speedy demarcation, Four Corners is<br />
now yet another Navajo Market &#8212; execpt they sell Navajo Frybread,<br />
something apparently uncommon to the other markets we found.  The Navajo<br />
Nation makes $2/person off of this little waypoint.  I&#8217;ve got to wonder &#8211;<br />
do they pay taxes in whatever quadrant of the parking lot they set their<br />
frybread stands in?  I dunno.  I asked the lady back before Tuba City<br />
whether or not they needed to charge tax, and she said that &#8220;Well, they<br />
are telling us we have to, but we are going to have a meeting tomorrow to<br />
discuss it&#8221;.
</p>
<p>The Navajo nation encompasses most of the eastern half of Arizona, and as<br />
far as I know, they pretty much have free reign over that territory.  The<br />
gas pumps are all ceritified by the &#8220;Navajo Weights and Measures Council&#8221;<br />
and even a lot of the radio promos (&#8220;win a car!&#8221;) were only open to those<br />
who live on the rez.  </p>
<p>Most of the folks on the rez are getting some sort of government<br />
assistance &#8212; SSI, Food Stamps, Welfare, etc, etc.  And I can see why.  We<br />
gave them this land &#8212; which by all accounts SHOULD be their land, but<br />
there isn&#8217;t anything on it.  Farms are pretty much non-existant, as is any<br />
real business.  The tourist trade out here is pretty prevalent, but<br />
something tells me it&#8217;s like the apple-salesmen during the Great<br />
Depression.  There are SO MANY stands out here, and most people are<br />
hawking the same sort of stuff.  And I can&#8217;t say for sure that stuff was<br />
exactly flying off the shelves.  It&#8217;s sad, really.  It&#8217;s a wasteland out<br />
here, in many regards, but I can&#8217;t say that isn&#8217;t a BAD thing.  Perhaps<br />
they like it this way.  It is quite  beautiful and untouched, and there<br />
COULD be strip-malls every mile rather than small vendors hawking homemade<br />
wares.

<p>We just turned onto US 666 heading east up to Cortez, CO and Durango.  The<br />
rock formations just keep getting better, and the shadows of the clouds on<br />
the plains and buttes are just gorgeous.  More later.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different:</p>
<p>Kelly would like to point out that on 2 lane highways, driving is a lot<br />
like a complicated and deadly game of leapfrog.  </p>
<p>We stopped in Pagosa Springs, CO to catch a bite to eat, and ate at the<br />
Hunan Chinese restaurant &#8212; in a word, unremarkable.  The food didn&#8217;t<br />
suck, per se, but it wasn&#8217;t great either.  Pagosa Springs is a quaint<br />
little town, with the San Juan River moseyingits way through town.  So<br />
far, all of the Colorado towns we&#8217;ve seen have been really neat.
</p>
<p>As we continue on US160 headed towards &#8220;Wolf Creek Pass&#8221;.  We see<br />
mountains beginning to tower before us.  We also note a sign that says<br />
&#8220;Wolf Creek Pass Closed 7PM to 7AM Mon-Thurs.  Suggest alternate route.&#8221;<br />
After doing a cursory examination of our &#8220;alternative routes&#8221;, we find<br />
that there aren&#8217;t any, really, and head on to the pass.  The time: 6:35PM.<br />
Wolf Creek Pass is in the San Juan Nat&#8217;l Forest, and it&#8217;s elevation is<br />
10,000 ft.  Pretty high.  Kelly&#8217;s little car is struggling from lack of<br />
oxygen, by the way.  It&#8217;s tough to maintain 45 miles per hour!  As we<br />
round one of the many steep hairpin turns, the tractor trailer in front of<br />
us has stopped in the middle of the road&#8230; I begin to shake my fist at<br />
him in true Ben style, but then realize his impass &#8212; a herd of mountain<br />
goats!  About two dozen, nervously eyeing the other side of the road,<br />
where two of their compatriots stand.  And then, all as one, they bolt to<br />
the other side.  Wow.  We&#8217;ve encountered a good amount of wildlife so far<br />
&#8211; what could be next?  I&#8217;m sorta hoping for snakes.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020502honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7536-2/05020158_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>At the top of the pass, there is a lot of snow.  It&#8217;s neat to see, really.<br />
Hills covered with hard-packed snow, and i really wanted to have a<br />
snowball fight, but Kelly wasn&#8217;t up for it.  We do take some pictures at a<br />
little stop-off atop the hill, though.  Finally, we reach the roadblock on<br />
Wolf Creek Pass, and we are literally the last ones allowed through for<br />
the day.  Turns out, they are doing blasting for a new tunnel down a<br />
rather treacherous part of I160.  After we get past the blockage, we make<br />
a stop at a little babbling brook.  It is SO still, so calming.  Kelly and<br />
I sit on a rock out in the middle of the stream, and just take it in.<br />
Pictures were taken.</p>

<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7560-2/05020170_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>We wind our way through a couple of small towns on US160, and decide to<br />
stop in Alamosa for the night.  A Comfort Inn is our respite.  The bed<br />
here was HUGE.  So huge, in fact, that there were THREE pillows laid<br />
abreast on the bed.  HUGE.</p>

	    <h2>tusayan, arizona (5 mis. south of the grand canyon).</h2>
<p>Wow.  Lots of travelling and seeing of stuff today.  We let out of our<br />
hotel (a Red Roof Inn) this morning at 9am with the express intention of<br />
finding two things:  the National Atomic Museum, and the Albuquerque Art<br />
Museum.  We stopped off at a McDonalds to get some breakfast.  All of this<br />
fast food is starting to get to us, i think.  I mean, it tastes good and<br />
all, but my acid stomach is starting to act up, and plus all the driving,<br />
well, lets just say i&#8217;m trying to eat more salads, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>So, we do a little back-tracking to find the Nat&#8217;l Atomic Museum, and run<br />
smack-dab into an Air Force Base.  We search around a little more, and<br />
find that that Air Force Base included the Sandia National Laboratory &#8211;<br />
one of the big atomic labs.  You needed some sort of credentials to get<br />
onto the base, so we decided to head onto the art museum. </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020501honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7119-2/05010001_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Now, the art museum is on &#8220;Mountain Avenue&#8221;, which intersects with &#8220;Rio<br />
Grande Blvd&#8221;.  Well, i look on the map, and see an &#8220;Montano Ave.&#8221; that<br />
meets up with Rio Grand Blvd.  I think &#8220;hmm.. .they must refer to Montano<br />
as Mountain&#8221; (right? right.) Kelly &#8212; a spanish major &#8212; goes along with<br />
this idea.  Let me say now that it was early, and it made sense at the<br />
moment.  The net connection in Albuquerque was rather shoddy, so i<br />
couldn&#8217;t get good directions.  Luckily for us, Albuquerque is small, and<br />
our map is decent.  (BTW, this $20 roadmap atlas i got at Borders in St.<br />
Louis is great. GREAT, i tell you).  (see sidenote about Borders in St.<br />
Louis, later on).</p>
<p>We finally find the Art museum, which is a small little set of buildings<br />
in the &#8220;Old Town&#8221; district.  As it would happen, Wednesday is a &#8220;free<br />
day&#8221;, and we save $4. Yay.  I must say, the art museum didn&#8217;t have so much<br />
art as it did Conquistador and Indian relics.  Some art upstairs, and a<br />
neat exhibit about the &#8220;Pie Town Homesteaders&#8221;.  Pie Town is a small town<br />
in southern New Mexico, and sadly, it no longer exists.  Luckily, thanks<br />
to the WPA and the NEA in the Depression, there was a photographer sent<br />
out to document pietown.  Lots of great black and white pictures.  Good<br />
stuff, that.  Anyway, there wasn&#8217;t a whole lot there else to see ($2<br />
worth, at least). </p>
<p>On to Arizona.  We head west again on I-40, travelling into Arizona, and<br />
the Navajo Reservation.  I had heard that there was a great little radio<br />
station that broadcast over the rez.  KTNN &#8211; AM 660, The Voice of the<br />
Navajo Nation.  Most of the broadcasting is done in the Navajo tongue,<br />
which I hadn&#8217;t heard before.  Navajo is an interesting spoken language.<br />
Very quick, and its hard to understand individual words.  I can only<br />
imagine the Japanese hearing this over Allied radio during WWII and<br />
thinking &#8220;what in the hell?!&#8221;.  However, the Navajo that I heard was often<br />
interspersed with English like &#8220;32 quart ice chest and six pack of Coke&#8221;<br />
and various English names.  They were doing a live remote from a general<br />
store, and were calling out winners names via the station.  The music<br />
choices were interesting country tunes.  I can handle this kind of country<br />
&#8211; it&#8217;s not the polished crap of the local Louisville stations.  No Garth<br />
Brooks, Shania Twain or that stuff.  Waylon Jennings, George Jones, etc.<br />
Also, there was a good amount of tribal songs as well.  I would like to<br />
point out that this was very independent radio.  Wonderful, wonderful.<br />
Thanks to the flat ground and the strong AM signal, we listened to this<br />
most of the way into Flagstaff, AZ.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020501honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7148-2/05010016_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>About 1/2 an hour outside of Flagstaff is a place I&#8217;ve always wanted to<br />
visit &#8212; Meteor Crater.  50,000 years ago, a meteorite slammed into this<br />
place, and there was left a mile-wide, 57 story deep crater, created in 10<br />
seconds.  The admission to this &#8220;hole in the ground&#8221; was $12, but dammit,<br />
I was gonna see this thing.  The wind here exceed all previous wind.<br />
Texas wind, East New Mexico wind, all bow down to Meteor Crater wind.<br />
Knock you off your feet, lose your hat wind.  Also, we were 7000 feet<br />
above sea level.  It was a little cold.  Pictures from Meteor Crater don&#8217;t<br />
do it justice.  Even while looking over it, it&#8217;s hard to believe you could<br />
fit the National City building in it.  At the bottom, they have placed a 6<br />
foot tall cutout of an astronaut.  It&#8217;s barely recognizable to the naked<br />
eye.  (They used the bottom of the crater as a staging ground for the<br />
Apollo missions, by the way).  The road up to the crater are unbound by<br />
fences, and cows are plentiful, much to Kelly&#8217;s delight. We stuck around<br />
for a bit, bought some souvenirs, and then we were off.  I&#8217;d like to point<br />
out that the high altitude has thinned the air considerably.  Some of the<br />
stairs at the crater took our breath quite easily.  Nutty.</p>

<p>Flagstaff is a tiny little motel-ridden town.  We decided to rather take<br />
US180 rather than 64 north, to take the scenic route.  This was a pretty<br />
good idea, and some of the most picturesque, high-altitude plains I&#8217;ve<br />
ever seen.  Along the side of the road was this tiny,tiny little chapel.<br />
It is triangular shaped, and open to the public.  It is a step up from a<br />
lean-to, and the pine boards on the inside are tacked with various<br />
votives, messages, and even a number of reservations for weddings, etc.<br />
Kelly and I snapped some photos on the inside, Kelly was pricked with<br />
barbed wire, and a pretty English woman took our picture. </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020501honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7202-2/05010043_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>A little down the road was the &#8220;White Buffalo&#8221; store.  They had white<br />
buffalo there, as you would imagine.  We stuffed two dollars into a<br />
&#8220;donation jug&#8221; and peeped us some buffalo.  Kelly noted they weren&#8217;t that<br />
exciting.  I noted that cows are pretty boring as well.  </p>
<p>Both of these places are set in a huge meadow of white/yellow grasses<br />
surrounded by mountains, some of which are topped with snow.  Beautiful.</p>
<p>Driving through the Kaibob National Forest, we ended up here in Tusayan,<br />
AZ.  A small little town that is really just a tourist waypoint.  The room<br />
here is a little more expensive than what we&#8217;ve been aiming for, but it&#8217;s<br />
close to the Grand Canyon, and we&#8217;d like to get as much time as possible<br />
tomorrow at the Canyon.</p>
<p>As it turns out, most of the guided tours (actually ALL) of them are not<br />
in service from April 29 &#8211; May 3, due to ranger training.  We will be<br />
hiking on public trails for the day, I think.  </p>
<p>Oh &#8212; i also think i made an international faux paus.  That pretty English<br />
girl that was at the tiny little chapel had a boyfriend &#8212; he was really<br />
tall.  So, when I saw a similar woman with some sort of accent and a<br />
really tall boyfriend at the Wendy&#8217;s we dined at, I waved and said<br />
&#8220;Hello!,&#8221; which was immediately met with confused looks.  I said, &#8220;You<br />
took our picture at the chapel on 180?&#8221; &#8220;It was triangular, remember?&#8221;.<br />
Apparently they didn&#8217;t.  Turns out, this was in fact NOT the English girl<br />
at all, though Kelly later relented that they did look quite the same.<br />
The reason I said anything to them at all is because this girl had an<br />
accent &#8212; it sounded vaguely english!  The tall dude with her said &#8220;Well,<br />
we are Canadian, so I guess we might have a bit of an accent, eh&#8221;.  Well,<br />
on they went, and we went back to the hotel, me wondering if I had just<br />
become an &#8220;ugly American&#8221;.  At least I didn&#8217;t just keep speaking louder<br />
and louder to them, like you do in France and Mexico &#8212; hoping they will<br />
understand your extremely loud English.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, after the Canyon, we head up towards Four Corners, where Arizon,<br />
New Mexico, Colorado and Utah meet.  It&#8217;s a tourist trap, for sure, but it<br />
will veer us around Oklahoma, and where else can I kiss Kelly in four<br />
states in less than a minute?  hehe. </p>
<p>After that, up to Pueblo, Colorado, Kit Carson, Colorado, and all points<br />
beyond.  </p>
<p>later!</p>
