		<description><![CDATA[Ben - thanks for bringing back &quot;Dad Day&quot; memories! Life becomes &quot;real&quot; at that moment – our lives AND theirs. That&#039;s the reason that thru all the sleepless nights, worries, trials and tribulations that we have never become extinct! It&#039;s all worth it and it&#039;s because of the feelings you feel from Day 1...and they only get stronger. Congratulations to you both!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[oh, she is so beautiful and we are so happy for you guys!  I&#039;m guessing that nurse Connie may be Connie Cuadros?  She is Lisa and Chris&#039;s mom from Eastern and she was the nurse that delivered yours truly 31 years ago.  She is a legend!
Congrats again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben, what a beautiful description of the days events!  One to be treasured for sure.  I know this internet stuff is supposed to be forever, but this is one that should be printed out (or better yet, written by hand) and saved in the baby book for Amelia to read one day.
Congratulations to you and Kelly!]]></description>
