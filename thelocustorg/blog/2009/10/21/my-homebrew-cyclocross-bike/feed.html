On the parts tip - yeah, the single ring is great for River Road Country Club, but Fishermans had me in my 28 tooth gear in the rear for most of the course. But, I chalk that up to being weak and shiftless (ha! see what I did there?)

I&#039;ll definitely hit up the Rogue tent to cheer for a bit after my race is run. I&#039;ve got some Hell for Certain to share.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[soooo, 3 years ago I had the exact same thing going on.  Different bike and all, but a ground up build made of what made sense to me.  Guess what?  I still have a &quot;built up&quot; bike instead of off the rack.  I like knowing that I researched and listened and went with a mix of parts that made sense for me.  I&#039;ve even made some wrong turns, but ended up with a bike that, like yours I know this bike.  Parts change and I went away from the single ring because of climby courses like Harbin Park and Gun Club, but you find what works and you run with it.  Plus its more personal than grabbing one off the rack.  
Cool bike, looking forward to racing with you this weekend.  Come have a beer with us at the LTP/RRP Tent.  We&#039;ll be set up wherever we can without getting kicked out.]]></description>
