		<description><![CDATA[As a firm believer in the daily plate, I always laugh when people ask me how I&#039;ve lost weight(I dropped 20lbs last year), its simple in concept and tough in execution. I still use TDP although not as religously as I did. I accept &quot;positive calorie days&quot; as long as they&#039;re balanced w neutral or negatives. Its simple math, and can&#039;t be disputed. A previous commenter hit a key point. As an athlete you MUST think about what the calories are(protein, fat etc) and properly fuel yourself. That&#039;s where it gets complicated and everybody&#039;s diff. Funny how the &quot;secret&quot; of weight loss/maintenance is something everybody knows and almost nobody does. Count.the damned. Calories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[just be aware of what makes up those calories, too. Protein is imortant as is fat, especially when you are in training. Avocado is a good source of healthy fat. And even Joe Friel(http://www.trainingbible.com/joesblog/blog.html) says starchy foods like potatoes and pasta are to be eaten within 30 minutes of finishing a long steady distance ride. 

Can&#039;t wait til March and STS!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BMI is notoriously inaccurate when it comes to muscular people.  I have a buddy that was a huge body builder and got stuck with high insurance rates because his BMI was high.  
Good luck!]]></description>
