		<description><![CDATA[Another easy appetizer that&#039;s a hit at parties is endive (so useful for finger foods) topped/filled with crumbled feta, chopped walnuts, chopped kalamatas, parsley and lemon zest. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice. 
Ooh, there&#039;s also potato pancakes topped with either sour cream or creme fraiche, chives and diced apple. One could also add pancetta bits. And it&#039;s so easy to fry the potato pancakes the day before and then re-crisp in the oven before serving. (they have to cool a bit before one can successfully apply the dairy.)]]></description>
