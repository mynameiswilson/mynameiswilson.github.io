		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, 
 
I am a long time fantasy baseball player here in the Louisville area. I&#039;ve been playing fantasy baseball since 1990, and have run at least one league a year as Commissioner since 1993. I&#039;m always looking for new leagues to join or for new owners to join my league. I did a Google search and ran across your blog here. I love the site by the way... you being a Cubs fan helps too. I hate to see Kerry go. Anywho, does your league have any openings for new players? Do you, or anyone you know, have any interest in joining another league? Just casting out the line and seeing what comes back... :)
 
Hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.
