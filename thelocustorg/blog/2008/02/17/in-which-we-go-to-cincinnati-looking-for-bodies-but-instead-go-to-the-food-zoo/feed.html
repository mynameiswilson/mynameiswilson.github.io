		<description><![CDATA[You two are traveling to Cincinnati while we two are traveling to Louisville... well, actually, not this past weekend, come to think of it. (No, we would go somewhere colder, more North, which absolutely makes no sense.) Anyhow, we&#039;re new to entire area, C &amp; L, and from our brief forays down there, liking Louisville quite a bit. If you happen to post any entries about what you dig (or not) about your city, I&#039;ll be tuning in. Oh, and I approve of your /liquid/ grocery cart selections.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trader Joe&#039;s is heaven on earth. So much deliciousness for so little money. I can never live in a city that doesn&#039;t have one. Whole Foods is another story. Sure, it&#039;s a cathedral to organic produce, but there&#039;s a reason for the nickname &quot;Whole Paycheck.&quot; Not TJ&#039;s, though. I&#039;m certain they&#039;re a money-laundering front for the mob, and that&#039;s how they keep their prices so low.

In other news, my parents sold my childhood home. My summer pool will now be located in Overland Park, Kansas.  :(  But if anyone needs a dining room set... (seriously, they&#039;re going to sell a bunch of stuff. Let me know if you need furniture.)]]></description>
