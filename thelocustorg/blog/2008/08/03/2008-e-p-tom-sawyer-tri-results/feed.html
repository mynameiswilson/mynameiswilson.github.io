		<description><![CDATA[Kevin - I can&#039;t stand races like that where people don&#039;t clap for ya at the end. Gotta give &#039;em a show, you know?  Glad you found my blog!

Jen - Ha! Yeah, all those delicious data points. I could have shaved like 5 seconds off if I didn&#039;t wear my cycling gloves. I ate a PowerBar on the bike, too - but I opened it before the race. I coulda been a contender! Congrats on your race, too - I&#039;ve been keeping tabs on ya.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, I am just as big of a nerd.  I spend hours (well, maybe minutes) importing all the results to excel and then sorting the crap out of them.  It is a great fun way to over-analyze every minor detail of the race!    I&#039;ll put mine on my blog soon.
Great job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, great race!

I&#039;m the guy who came up on you at the end of the run, in the photo. :) Hilarious, I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m on your blog!  Another triathlete here in the office came across the pics a few minutes ago.  What is also funny is that I had been reading your blog a week or so ago, I just happened across it looking for triathlon info (this past Saturday was my first triathlon).  Anyway, it was too funny seeing the pics and reading the description (which was accurate).  Glad you took it in good humor, it was all in good fun.  We gave them something to look at there at the finish line, eh?  Plus you helped bring down my pace a couple seconds, I&#039;m sure.

Thanks for putting the results in Excel format, by the way.

Congrats on the race, good luck in the future.

(PS - You had me for sure, I didn&#039;t have as much gas left in me.)]]></description>
