		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m digging the new layout!  I swear, someday I&#039;m going to make it down to the &#039;Ville so we can hang out.  Maybe I can make it down there for a Bats game or something.  Or, maybe you guys came come up here for a Reds game.  Or maybe some other scenario.  Who knows?

To anyone reading the comments that I know, Hi Everybody!
