		<description><![CDATA[Joe had the best delivery.  It&#039;s strangely comforting to think of Ben and Joe in heaven together cracking everyone up.

I also have this to add from Joe&#039;s folks:
THANKS,

Mardi and I want to thank all his friends that stuck by Joe during his seven
year rollercoaster ride. When it would have been easier to jump off you
chose to ride with him.  Joe&#039;s last several months were truly heart
wrenching, especially to his family.  You, his friends, made his time more
meaningful with calls, visits, parties and card games.

I remember asking Joe at the beginning of his sophomore year at Hanover what
he was going to declare as a major.  Joe told me theater.  I distinctly
recall saying, &quot;hell son, I will be supporting you the rest of your life&quot;.
Although it became reality now I can see God had it planned all along!  Joe
touched so many people thru his plays, humor and love of life.

As I repeated to you&#039;all several times this past week, THANKS, THANKS,
THANKS for being Joe&#039;s friends. Your great!

Don and Mardi Crosser]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I, too, like my memories of high school Joe. (for better or worse, there are more of those) It seems like my memories of Joe almost always couple him with Ben Edelson. Quite a pair, those two. Remember the crazy birthday gifts? Julie, your mime kit?
And was Joe the person who had the &quot;you&#039;re pretty, like my mom&quot; line in that BAMF skit?
If anyone ever deserved a fan club...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not the one to eulogize Joe - others closer to him have done that already, and are better suited.  So, instead, I chose to write about how his &quot;cancer journey&quot; affected us all, because that is what I was closest to. I knew Joe with cancer considerably longer than I did without cancer.  Luckily, he did not let that completely define his being - and he was more Joe than cancer for a vast majority of his life.

I think Hunter said it best - &quot;he did everything he could with the hand he was dealt, and as ever he played his hand well&quot;.  That&#039;s paraphrased, but you get the point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once again I&#039;m back at your blog trying to say the un-sayable. How do you put the loss of such a good person into words? I can&#039;t even begin to describe the memory of Joe. I know that you already know so I guess I&#039;ll just save it.

It&#039;s comforting to me to read what you have written. It was a sad, hard ending for such a lively mind. When he &quot;visited&quot; to go to Duke for checkups we were all a little uncomfortable with the cancer standup routine....but maybe it&#039;s just one of those games with rules we don&#039;t understand and the punchline will eventually be revealed.

I don&#039;t know. Even though it wasn&#039;t a surprise it&#039;s still hard to believe.]]></description>
