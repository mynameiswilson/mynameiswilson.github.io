		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve mentioned Achewood before, like &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/557&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/575&quot;&gt;sorta here&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/646&quot;&gt;a little here&lt;/a&gt;.

But certainly not in relation to my love and dedication to the strip.  Kelly is just recently a big fan....

Oh, a good picture of me sporting some Achewood gear is &lt;a href=&quot;http://louisvillesoaring.org/index.php?set_albumName=20051105frankfort&amp;id=20051105_frankfort_05_benthrow&amp;option=com_gallery&amp;Itemid=&amp;include=view_photo.php&quot;&gt;here @ LouisvilleSoaring.org&lt;/a&gt;, and I put my beer in an &lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/v/projects/homebrew/20051117coffeestout/20051117-coffeestout-03-relaxandhaveahomebrew.jpg.html&quot;&gt;Achewood glass&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, so up until Thursday I had never seen Achewood.  That has all changed now.  I have read the entire strip, from 10/01/2001 through Sound and Motion succumbing to the flying elbow, at the expense of much coding.  You could say that I am now thoroughly addicted.  Ben, couldn&#039;t you have waited until the conclusion of the Great Outdoor Fight arc to post the link?  Then I wouldn&#039;t be jonesing for the next strip.  Damn it all!  Damn, I say!]]></description>

The storyline&#039;s are just flowing into each other.  My prediction right now is that Beef throws the fight, allowing Ray to fulfill his destiny.]]></description>
