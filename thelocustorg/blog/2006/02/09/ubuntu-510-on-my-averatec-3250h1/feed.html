		<description><![CDATA[i install ubuntu 5.10 a few days ago on my 3500 and it installed and so far i&#039;ve gotten everything to work fine, except USB.

@John: there&#039;s a lot of information on setting up wireless access in ubuntu, but 1 thing i found is that my onboard wireless chip is ra0 and not wlan0, so you might have to change that.

but what you need to do is double click your connection, and change the name to whatever &lt;ra0&gt; then hit configure.
then click the wireless connection, or which ever is showing as using your wireless card, and hit properties. fill evreything in and hit ok, then activate it and give it a minute.

hope everythign works, and bryce have you had any USB problems?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey buddy,
I have one of these same laptops with Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake.  Did you have any problems getting on the web with it?  How do you set up wifi and the wired cable ethernet?  I&#039;m having problems.  Is your ethernet port suppose to flash when it works correctly?  I have no light at the port at all so part of me thinks the port is broke.  I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m a linux newb so it is all disheartening to me.  Thanks for any help you may be able to give.  :)

Thanks,
John]]></description>
