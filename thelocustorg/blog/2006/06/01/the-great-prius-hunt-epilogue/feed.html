		<description><![CDATA[Dream come true, indeed!  For years, Kelly and I would see one and say &quot;someday, that will be ours!&quot;

I enjoy it not only because it&#039;s a hybrid and it&#039;s very economical on the gas, but also because it&#039;s a car that I can *use*!  The hatchback and the roominess were really the big selling points for me.

Thanks for the kind words.]]></description>
