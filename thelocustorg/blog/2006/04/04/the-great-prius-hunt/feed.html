		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, we certainly considered a LOT of cars, including the Honda Hybrids, Subarus, Volkswagens, etc.  As Kelly mentioned, the Prius is big on the inside and I read up on Consumer Report&#039;s reliability stats on the Prius.  They had the lowest number of &quot;incidents&quot; in their first year of ANY car.  I was happy about that :)  They&#039;ve been around since 2001 and reading the Prius forums, I&#039;ve yet to see any major complaints.

I briefly considered a diesel Jetta wagon because of the fuel economy, but they don&#039;t make them anymore!  Also, VW&#039;s service records are even worse than some domestics.

I really just wanted a reliable wagon that got decent gas mileage.  Matt&#039;s Mazda 6 (or whatever the model is) was up for consideration there for a while, but I wanted something just a little bigger.  Also, the Prius is WAY cool.  Computers and such!  Awesome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well, the prius has a much larger interior. the hwtchback is handy. we want a 4 door, which rules out the insught, and the civic has a different type of hybrid engine, which i read somewhere (can&#039;t remeber where, it was a hile ago) that the prius is a more &quot;true&quot; hybrid engine.  also, i&#039;m a bit partial to toyota (probably because my first car wa a tercel), and the prius has the best service record, according to consumer reports. yeah, the first year they had some problems, and they also were in these weird easter eggs colors, but both aspects have been greatly improved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the Honda hybrid cars?  The Insight has a MSRP of around $21K, the Civic Hybrid is around $21K as well.  The Accord is a little pricy at around $33k.  Personally, I&#039;d choose the Honda over the Toyota.  I&#039;ve heard that the Prius had some serious problems in their first year because they were rushed to market because of the success of the Insight.  I don&#039;t know how (or if) those problems have been fixed, but I&#039;d certainly give the Hondas a look-see.]]></description>
