		<description><![CDATA[I just saw the message - how funny!  Ella&#039;s word for all things animal is &quot;DAT&quot; (dog, cat, whatever...).  She points and says &quot;DAT!&quot; anytime she sees an animal.  Luckily she hasn&#039;t said goddamnit yet, but I fear it is only a few months away!  Thanks for the article!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, I seem to have the wrong email address for y&#039;all, so here&#039;s hoping you notice this comment while perusing the Locust:

The SF Chronicle has this hilarious parenting blog that I read for fun. (it really is chuckly.)

A recent post was about baby&#039;s first words, and this story was in the comments section.


&quot;Given my daughter&#039;s fascination with all animals (probably from weekly trips to the zoo) it was no surprise to hear her say &quot;animal&quot; as we approached the zoo entrance one day.

&quot;What was a surprise was hearing her mutter &quot;goddammit&quot; on a recent trip to the grocery store. I gave her a jar of peanut butter to &quot;play&quot; with (that I knew she couldn&#039;t open). She tried and tried to get her little hands to turn the lid - and then she swore. I thought the man standing next to me was going to fall over laughing!&quot;
