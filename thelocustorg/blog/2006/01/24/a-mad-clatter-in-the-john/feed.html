		<description><![CDATA[...he&#039;s lucky this hasn&#039;t happened before.

I forgot - this reminded me of something. A long time ago, I was &#039;talking&#039; with some guy over ham radio, a few states away, using Morse code (yeah, I know, nerdier than a 50-sided die), and my cat came thru the drop ceiling in my room (there was an access and she loved to get up there...very private, I suppose). It made quite a racket and startled me, but I kept rythm for the most part, and said &quot;...wait...uh got to go old man, cat came thru ceiling...no joke...sorry...bye....73 de ae4rv...&quot;

The cat was fine, btw.]]></description>
