		<description><![CDATA[Go Kelly Go!
This is an awesome undertaking and you should be so proud of yourself.  I cant imagine the dedication, hours and shear mental determination you have to train and compete in these three athletic disciplines (and at these distances). 

Forget the clock, listen to your body and ENJOY THE DAY. 

We&#039;ll be cheering for you!]]></description>
