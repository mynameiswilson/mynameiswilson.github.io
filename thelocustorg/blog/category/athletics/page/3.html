	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>On Saturday, Kelly and I rode 100 miles on our bicycles along the <a href="http://ironman.com/louisville" target="_blank">2008 Louisville IronMan</a> route. I had originally only intended to do 80, which Kelly amended to 87. And if I&#8217;m going to be spending 6 hours on a bike saddle then I might as well make it worthwhile and go 100, right?</p>
<p>New, previously unexplored thresholds of pain and exhaustion were met and exceeded. That was the longest time I had ever been on a bike <em>or constantly moving</em> in my entire life. According to MapMyRun, a man for my height/weight/age running at a 16 MPH pace for 100 miles would burn in excess of 5000 calories. 5000!  That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=big+mac+calories" target="_blank">9 Big Macs</a> or nearly 32 cans of soda. I ate 3 <a href="http://www.powerbar.com/Products/Performance/" target="_blank">PowerBars</a>, 3 <a href="http://www.guenergy.com/" target="_blank">Gu <em>Roctane</em> packets</a>, one bottle of Ale-8-One and one 12oz can of Coca-Cola. This adds up to a calorie deficit of somewhere between 3000-4000 calories. Insane!</p>
<p>The course we followed was essentially the IronMan course that Kelly will be riding for some 7-8 hours at the end of August. It was extremely hilly for the first 50 miles, with a combination of steep climbs, screaming downhills and a heinous grade on KY-393 that just goes on and on and on.  The last 30 miles back to Louisville along US42 is rolling, but generally downhill.  As I predicted to Kelly the week prior &#8220;I will be able to keep up with you up until mile 50 or 60, and then please just don&#8217;t leave me out on the course&#8221;. I hit 60 miles on the nose and was just wiped. All climbs were painful and punctuated with my muttering a single, choice curse word at the top of each hill. Recovering on the downhill only to repeat multiple times.</p>
<p>You can check out the course on MapMyRun&#8217;s nifty course widget:</p>

<p>There was a group of maybe two dozen out-of-state IronMan trainees there to ride the course on Saturday, and we had a number of pleasant chats here and there. We stopped at the mini-marts along the course and made sure to spend a little dough at each store on water and such. We didn&#8217;t have many problems with the auto traffic, but we did have an SUV full of kids <em>throw a beer</em> at us while on the return trip down US42. Seriously, license plate KY 163-GDV?</p>
<p>Along that save vein, Todd Heady over at <a href="http://headfirstperformance.com/CyclingProblems.htm" target="_blank">HeadFirstPerformance.com</a> has written a thought-provoking article on &#8220;<a href="http://headfirstperformance.com/CyclingProblems.htm" target="_blank">Cycling Problems</a>&#8220;. Timely as he talks about road-closures, the people who live and work and own businesses along road courses and the relationship between them and those who bike on the courses. Todd&#8217;s a certifiably insane athlete, but when it comes to organizing races or giving his opinion on tough matters he&#8217;s pretty darn reasonable.</p>
<p>And then, the next day&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>2008 AMA/LSF Soaring Nationals Handlaunch</strong></p>
<p>I awoke at 5:00am to drive back up to beautiful Muncie, IN for the 2008 AMA/LSF Soaring Nationals to compete in the handlaunch competition!  Much to my surprise I was ambulatory and did pretty well at the competition until the last two rounds, as is my custom at the NATS.  I placed 6th out of 22 and returned home with a plaque (&#8220;getting wood&#8221; as it&#8217;s known in the hobby).  You can read up on my exploits here in the <a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/events/nats/NatsNews08/0728.pdf" target="_blank">AMA&#8217;s NATSNews coverage for July 28th</a>.</p>
<p>You might remember that <a href="../../../2007/08/03/soaring-nats-wrapup.html">I covered the 2007 Soaring NATS last year</a>, writing the NATSNews coverage each day. Unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t do it this year partially because of our Fall &#8217;07 trip to Barcelona, but also because I wanted to be around to help Kelly train for her IronMan race.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I&#8217;ve got the <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/E6B908F3-C68C-4BBB-8B91-9EECA80F11A9/0/Triathlon08.pdf" target="_blank">2008 E. P. Tom Sawyer Triathlon</a> coming up this Saturday? Yeah, &#8217;cause I do. Oh, and Power Creative has a softball game on Sunday versus the delightfully-named <em>Got Balls? </em>softball team.</p>

<p>Well, the <a href="http://www.muncieendurathon.com" target="_blank">2008 Muncie Endurathon</a> triathlon is in the bag, and boy was it a doozie! By far the largest triathlon event Kelly or I had ever participated in. Also very well run and in a great location (the Prairie Creek Reservoir in southeast Muncie). For those of you who are blinking your eyes and wonder &#8220;what is a triathlon?&#8221; let me explain (after the jump)</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t learn to ride a two-wheeled bike until I was 8 &#8211; but it was all downhill after that.</p>
<p>Ran into a car backing out of a driveway when I was 10 or 11, knocked me for a loop.</p>
<p>That same bumper-sticker covered bike was stolen a few months later off of our front stoop.</p>
<p>I felt violated.</p>
<p>Learned to bunny-hop a few years after that. Made ramps out of stolen street-signs.</p>
<p>Saw my brother crack his noggin on the driveway in the rain on his bike.</p>
<p>Did my first 60 mile ride when I was 13 or 14 in the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Never went farther than that until this year.</p>
<p>I enjoy the speed and the silence and thrumming sound of wheels on the road or trail. Alive and in-motion. Hope I can keep it up.</p>

	    <p><em>Update:</em> Check out my <a href="../../../2008/07/17/muncie-endurathon-wrap-up.html">2008 Muncie Endurathon Wrap-Up</a> race report!</p>
<p>This weekend, Kelly and I will be heading up to Muncie, Indiana &#8211; and not for a <a href="../../../../soaring.html">soaring</a> event like the <a href="../../../2007/08/03/soaring-nats-wrapup.html">NATS</a>! Shocking! (I am going to the NATS for only one day this year) But back to the event at hand &#8211; the <a href="http://www.muncieendurathon.com" target="_blank">Muncie Endurathon</a>, a half-Ironman distance race that Kelly is using as a tune-up for the full-sized <a href="http://ironman.com/louisville">Louisville Ironman</a>. Me? I&#8217;m doing the little, tiny, itty-bitty &#8220;sprint&#8221; distance triathlon. Let&#8217;s compare, shall we?</p>
<pre><strong>       Half Ironman   Sprint</strong></pre>
<pre>Swim   1.2 mi         0.3 mi</pre>
<pre>Bike  56.0 mi        12.3 mi</pre>
<pre>Run   13.1 mi         3.1 mi</pre>
<pre><strong>Total 70.3 mi        15.7 mi
</strong></pre>
<p>So, as you can see&#8230; Kelly is both stronger and crazier than me.</p>
<p>The good news is that I&#8217;ve been doing most of my swim training for an 800 meter distance (which is what the E.P. Tom Sawyer Sprint triathlon demands), and even stretching those workouts to 1600 meters.  Couple that with me actually training for the bike this year on a <a title="LeMond Reno cycle" href="http://lemondbikes.com/bikes/road_racing/performance_aluminum/reno.php" target="_blank">*real* road bike</a> that fits me. I actually rode the bike distance yesterday and averaged well over 17 MPH for the entire course, which included Dog Hill, Hogan&#8217;s Fountain and the Seneca Golf Course hill in Cherokee Park. Feelin&#8217; good about that. And the run? Uh&#8230; well, yeah I haven&#8217;t put on my running shoes in a couple of months. I&#8217;ll be OK, though. I can do 3 miles.</p>
<p>The last event I did like this was last year&#8217;s E.P. Tom Sawyer triathlon, in which I placed 12th out of 13 in my age group. I did the 800m swim/14 mi bike/5k run in 1:47. The bike I did in 51 minutes or so &#8211; and it nearly killed me, adding some 3 1/2 minutes to my 5k time. That works out to be some 11 MPH average or something horrible. I should do better this time round. Also, it helps that at least at EP that the 30-34 age group is slower than the 25-29 age group. Yay.</p>

<p>Hopefully some photos and junk this weekend!</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re at it, go and read Kelly&#8217;s triathlon training blog, <a href="http://wannatrisome.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Wanna Tri Some?</a>. The last few posts have been really great.</p>

	    <p>Yesterday was the 2008 <a href="http://www.derbyfestivalmarathon.com/" target="_blank">Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon</a>, a 13.1-mile road running race. (As well as mine and Kelly&#8217;s 6th wedding anniversary). Kelly got me to train and run the miniMarathon last year, and it would appear that running has stuck with me &#8211; and I&#8217;m faster this year than the last! The miniMarathon follows the &#8220;<a href="http://www.louisvilletriplecrown.com/" target="_blank">Triple Crown of Running</a>,&#8221; which consists of a 5k (3.1mi), 10k (6.2mi) and a 10 mile race, and makes a great training schedule.  Below are my 2007 and 2008 race times for all four races:</p>

<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ben-minimarathon-2007.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-853" title="Ben at the 2007 miniMarathon" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ben-minimarathon-2007-198x300.jpg" alt="Ben at the 2007 miniMarathon" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>So, on the whole, roughly 2% faster than last year. I didn&#8217;t crack the 25 minute 5k yet, like I&#8217;ve wanted to, but the year is still young &#8211; and I&#8217;ve dramatically improved my times at that distance. The Rodes time improved slightly, but the Papa Johns time went south just a touch.  I wonder why that is?  Could have just been something that day.  The one thing I find interesting is that both of my miniMarathon paces are faster than my two Papa John&#8217;s times, with the two races having almost the same course. I think the faster pace time on the mini as compared to the Papa John&#8217;s and the only marginal yearly speed increase (despite me thinking that I trained better and felt better during the 2008 races) in speed this year are due to the same thing &#8211; the miniMarathon is the object of my training, and&#8230; I <em>wanted it more</em> last year!  It&#8217;s amazing what a little inspiration can do for you.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve started cycling with Kelly and I&#8217;m looking forward to doing the E. P. Tom Sawyer sprint triathlon (800m swim, 14 mile bike and 5k run).  It&#8217;s a fun race, despite the fact that I was really slow last year (<a href="http://headfirstperformance.com/Results/EP07.htm" target="_blank">see my results here</a>, 15th out of 16 in the 25-29 age group).</p>

	    <p>As promised, today was Ben and Kelly&#8217;s <em>Chicago Art Day</em>!   We took some photos and put them in the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051011chicago/">2005.10.11 &#8211; Chicago Marathon: ART DAY!</a> gallery.</p>

<p>We slept in until about 9:30 or so and I ran down to <em>Chicago Take-Out</em> in the bottom floor of the hotel to get Kelly a &#8220;thing with things in it&#8221; which I took to mean a veggie omelette.  Me?  I was in the mood for pancakes and bacon.  I don&#8217;t each much bacon, but I do love it, especially with maple syrup.</p>
<p>I should also make a note about the &#8220;family&#8221; of people who run the <em>Chicago Take-Out</em>.  If pressed, I&#8217;d have to say they aren&#8217;t Russian, and they aren&#8217;t quite Greek &#8212; somewhere in between.  Maybe Armenian.  They are all very short (save for the one) and have the demeanor of folks who have been short-ordering to we gringo tourists for a little too long.  So when the young cook (perhaps a young <em>Turk</em>?) told me <em>&#8220;I make you best breakfast in town &#8212; any time of day!  You get up 3 PM  I make you chicken &#8212; BOK BOK BOK!&#8221;</em> and smiled a shivvy smile, which made me smile after I realized he was joking.   I want you to think of a cross between Eddie Munster and Squiggy from Laverne and Shirley.  Then when I reminded him that I also had two coffees, he said &#8220;Not me, man &#8211; you tell her!&#8221; pointing his thumb in the direction of the older lady behind the counter, who earlier had said &#8220;Your machine is broken!  No paper! No paper!&#8221; in regards to the short-order printer.   <em>Tee-hee</em>, I&#8217;m a sucker for ethnic banter, I guess.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I was hyped to get down to the <a class="External" href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, so we took a right turn out of the hotel and down to Grant Park for a scenic route and a snapshot of the fountain.   On the way, we passed by some of the <em>many</em> art students that are in this south-end of the Downtown.  These happened to be apparently shooting something in 16mm film involving a wooden cross.  I&#8217;ll admit to thinking &#8220;Oh, please!  16mm and a cross?  Art <em>preschoolers</em> do that every day before they take their naps!  Go have a milk.&#8221;  But they are here in this big city sowing their artistic oats before the crushing reality of the real world shoulder-checks them into designing whimsical cocktail napkins for Bunco parties.  But I shouldn&#8217;t be so cynical.  Or maybe I should be &#8212; cynicism about art is what keeps high art high and <em>low art</em> profitable.</p>
<p>The Art Institute is a fabulous place, if not terribly confusing.  Large, parquet-floored wings with no real obvious <em>pathways</em> which lead to a lot of map-looking and backtracking to ensure you&#8217;ve seen everything.   I haven&#8217;t been to many art museums, though, so this might be par for the course.</p>
<p>Considering I had <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/413">been here before</a>, I knew what I had wanted to see again, and found myself saving certain wings for last &#8211; savoring them, I guess.   Kelly and I have in the last few days been having an ongoing conversation about what is art and what is not.  For grotesque instance, shitting on a canvas in front of an audience to Kelly is not &#8220;art&#8221; because it follows her dictum that &#8220;If [Kelly] can do it, it is not art&#8221;.  I understand that idea and I used to think that myself.  However, as my consideration of art as a thing and art as an idea changed that rule faltered.  Let me explain&#8230;</p>
<p>A good example is the apparently time-honored tradition of the peformance art shitter.  Shitting on things is really what humans do best.  Literally <em>anyone</em> can do that.  And anyone <em>will</em> do that.  So then, the real art of shitting on things &#8212; canvasses, flags, other artist&#8217;s pieces of shit-art &#8212; is the whole production of the piece.  Who in their <em>right mind</em> would shit in public?  Very few &#8212; hobos and artists come to mind.  Hobos do it out of necessity.  Artists do it to remind you that everyone shits &#8212; or if they are wearing a star-spangled top-hat, that America is <em>the shit</em>.  The point is is that they actually did it, for you to see, and that according to one woman&#8217;s account, if someone paid to see it, it is art.  That said, shitting on flags is not gonna get my dollar.   Shitting on flag shitters maybe &#8212; a documentary on the design, preparation and ultimate performance and cleanup of a sucessful flag-shitting &#8212; <em>yes</em>!  I love documentaries.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Anyway, back to the Art Institute.  We saw all that could be seen, and certainly took photos (no flashy).  The great exhibit of papal artifacts in the &#8220;gun and knife show&#8221; wing that was there a few years ago when Hunter and I went was sadly gone, as were many of the awesome combinations of sword-and-gun that we observed last time.  Sad!   But I was really there for the Magrittes they have on permanent display.  I can&#8217;t really say what it is about Magritte that interests me so, but I think it has something to do with the amount that some of his work transfixes me.  You may have seen his paintings like &#8220;Time Transfixed&#8221; or &#8220;The Son of Man&#8221;, which when compared to the fantastic images that Dali painted are rather&#8230; pedestrian.  In fact, the man in the painting &#8220;The Son of Man&#8221; could very well have been a pedestrian -and the argument could be made that Magritte painted such subjects in a surreal way to get just that effect.  But there are many Magritte works that are not as obviously <em>surreal</em> and play more to his mastery of light and shadow, like &#8220;The Voice of Blood&#8221; or &#8220;The Empire of Light&#8221;.    The one painting that I think mixes both of these sides of Magritte the best and makes for the simplest yet most indelible of marks is &#8220;The Banquet&#8221; (shown above) which is on display at the Art Institute.  Upon first encountering it in the flesh a few years ago, I was completely captured by it.  As with many paintings &#8212; it does little to impress when shown 3&#8243; x 4&#8243; on a computer monitor.  They may as well throttle you by the throat in real life.  I used to think that art could be seen in books on a screen &#8212; but that is not the case.</p>

<img class="FloatRight" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/13017-2/20051011_chicago_37_benintheglow.jpg" alt="in the glow" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>After the Art Institute, we decided to check out the <a class="External" href="http://www.mcachicago.org/">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> specifically for the Dan Flavin Retrospective there until October 30, 2005.  I saw a subway poster for this on an L platform in Chicago, and was immediately reminded of the NPR piece I heard <em>last</em> October entitled <a class="External" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4056030">Dan Flavin&#8217;s Fantastic Lights</a>.   The premise sounded simple enough: one man uses off-the-shelf fluorescent lights to create his art.  What one can&#8217;t fully grasp on the radio or even on the web is just how much his art relies upon it&#8217;s surroundings.  His medium is truly light, and hence, reflection is the eventual outcome.  Paintings are graced by frames, but his art can be recreated in any room and will thereby become a different piece altogether!</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051011chicago/20051011_chicago_29_flavin4.jpg.html"><br />
<img class="FloatLeft" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/12993-2/20051011_chicago_29_flavin4.jpg" alt="Dan Flavin" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>The entire 4th floor of the MCA was without any lights save for Flavin&#8217;s works.  (They had even gone so far as to remove the fluoresecents from the ceiling fixtures!)  The longest work in the hall stretched before a long series of windows facing the street &#8212; reflecting it&#8217;s beautiful green glow upon not only the ceiling and walls of the floor, but the museum itself &#8211; a beacon to all that passed by.<br />
To enter that floor was to enter a world of otherworldly lights.  At first it was difficult to stand, but after a few moments, you got used to the 60Hz pulse of the lights and passing between rooms (which often housed a single piece) meant changing the tint of the world in which you operated.  Inspecting a piece close-up was to ruin the spectre of what the hardware had created.  Each person in the room became part of the piece, part of the canvas and it was breathtaking. <em>A sidenote: photography was not allowed in the gallery, so I had to be sneaky.</em></p>
<p>Later that evening, we went to go see <a class="External" href="http://www.secondcity.com/?id=theatres/chicago/mainstage">The Second City&#8217;s Mainstage</a> doing the show <em>The Red Scare</em>, a long-running show playing with the differences and similarities between the left- and the right-wingers in the world.  Absolutely hilarious!  Some really great stuff there and a visit to Chicago isn&#8217;t complete without seeing the Second City.  I&#8217;ve been there twice (once to the Mainstage and once to one of their &#8220;lesser&#8221; shows&#8221;) and have been totally destroyed by the funny both times.</p>

	    <p>Or, perhaps <em>The Blizzard of Destiny</em>!</p>
<p>But first, last night&#8230;</p>

</a><br />
Last night after the marathon, we met Kelly&#8217;s friends Howard and Ande for a meal at Joey Buono&#8217;s Pizza just off Michigan Avenue.  I had a very tasty Goose Island Oktoberfest beer along with some decent calamari.  The real winner was the &#8220;Quatro Staggione&#8221; pizza that had four different quadrants of various and nummy toppings.  Excellent.  (And then I had a tasty Stella Artois).</p>
<p>Afterwards, we headed down to the Navy Pier for the &#8220;after-party&#8221;.  Thanks to the wonderful mass transit they have here, we hopped on a bus and were there in no time.  However, once inside the pier, we had to walk the entire length of the damned thing (which is <em>far</em>) to get to the &#8220;Grand Ballroom&#8221;.   I, the only member of the party who hadn&#8217;t run the race had no problems and enjoyed the stained glass exhibit running a good 1/4 mile along the inside of the pier mall.  The others hobbled along behind.</p>
<p>The after-party was pretty hoppin&#8217; &#8212; all sorts of free food and nearly-free alcohol, replete with a nutty cover band called <a class="External" href="http://theparamours.com/">The Paramours</a>.  We, despite being stuffed with pizza, sampled the fare and the liquid assets.   Also, we got Kelly&#8217;s official time: 4:40:12!</p>
<p>This morning, we slept in as late as we wanted and decided to try and find Kelly&#8217;s <em>Blizzard of Destiny</em>, the confection foretold by prophecy to officially end Kelly&#8217;s marathon saga.  The <a class="External" href="http://www.dairyqueen.com">Dairy Queen</a> website said something about a DQ at 69 Washington Street, only a few blocks away from us. We had our destination.</p>
<p>So, standing there at 69 W. Washington and not seeing a DQ, we were confused!  Feeling dejected we tracked down a phone book in the basement of the nearby Sears.  222 S. Riverside Plaza!  Only a few MORE blocks away.  First, feeling hungry, we decided to hop into the nearby <a class="External" href="http://www.cosi.com">Cosi</a> for some lunch.  I&#8217;d heard about Cosi from the David Cross bit about &#8220;Squagels&#8221; the square bagels.  <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s for breakfast as COSI?!&#8221;</em>.  Ultimately a little bit of a let-down as it was essentially a collection of <em>Hot Pocket</em> style sandwiches that at least adventurous, though more expensive than Panera.  But I digress&#8230;  After lunch, we trucked on over to 222 S. Riverside Plaza and found it to be an Amtrak station.  Walking downstairs to the Food Court we were greeted with even further dejection!  Boo!  According to the helpdesk, it had moved out a while back.  <em>Dang.</em><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051010chicago/"><br />
<img class="FloatRight" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/12836-2/20051010_chicago_02_DQ.jpg" alt="Dairy Queen" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>The next closest one was on W. Irving Park, which was a good haul away in Northwest Chicago.  Kelly, now truly in the dumps after being let down twice by Dairy Queen, and forecasting that she&#8217;d &#8220;break down and cry&#8221; if the next DQ was not where it said it was, was nonetheless a trooper and we started on our way.  Not even knowing if it still existed, we took the Green Line to the Blue Line (like 10 stops out) and then took a bus for 16 blocks.  The DQ <em>in sight</em> and <em>open</em>!  Huzzah!  Kelly ordered a Medium Strawberry Cheesecake Blizzard and I had a Small Oreo Blizzard.  All was well in the cosmos.  All was <em>tasty</em>.  And it had only taken a plane ride, a marthon, at least 4 train rides and a bus to complete.<a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051010chicago/"><br />
<img class="FloatLeft" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/12854-2/20051010_chicago_08_discard.jpg" alt="Discard" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>While on the way back on the Blue Line from Irving Park (which, by the way, is were I saw my second shoving-match in public of this vacation) we decided to stop at Logan Park, which I incorrectly remembered as where I had been 2 years before on a <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/413">similar adventure with Hunter to find a &#8216;zine distributor</a>.  Nonetheless, Logan Park was neat little Latino/Polish area with a GAP Outlet store (and a Payless).  I managed to impress Kelly by picking out not one but two smart ensembles of fall-inspired shirts and sweaters (with jeans).  It takes so very little to impress Kelly.  Later, we went to the Payless Shoes and saw a woman get nabbed for shoplifting.  She was wearing a velour track suit and when the attendee caught her at the door, she simulatenously said &#8220;Oh?  I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; and comically pulled out a feather boa-like thing from the front pouch of her sweatshirt, as if it were a scarf and she was a magician.  I guess it was a bit scarf-like, but dang, lady &#8212; a shoplifting wrap for a crappy scarf?</p>
<p>Later, we kicked it back to the hotel for a brief respite and then headed out for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the base of the Hancock Building.  We ate a tasty grilled artichoke appetizer (the discarded leaves of which Kelly made a little hut).  I continued on my Goose Island (the closest thing to a local beer around here) tip and Kelly ate some Fish Tacos and I had the &#8220;Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp&#8221; which was tasty, but as Kelly put it:  &#8220;This tastes like just &#8220;eh&#8230; <em>bang</em> chicken and shrimp&#8221;.  Not terribly spicy at all.</p>
<p>Tomorrow:  It&#8217;s <em>ART DAY</em>!</p>

<p>I ate a Chicago Hot Dog.  My role in this adventure is complete!</p>
<p>Kelly runs tomorrow at 8AM CST.  You can track Kelly via email or TXT messaging: <a class="External" href="http://www.chicagomarathon.com/page_L2.aspx?subMenu=3&amp;Page_ID=287&amp;Nav_2_ID=301&amp;Page_Title=Runner%20Tracking%20&amp;%20Updates">Chicago Marathon Runner Tracking</a>.  I will be following Kelly via the CTA trains and taking photos &#8212; perhaps updating while the race is going on!</p>
