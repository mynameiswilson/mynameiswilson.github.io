Man, so much good music this year!  All this good music coupled with <a href="http://www.indietorrents.com" class="External">IndieTorrents</a> have led to a banner year of me listening to good music.  With all the hype and stuff about BitTorrent and the busts that have occurred as of late, I&#8217;ll tell you that A) IndieTorrents deals only with non-<a href="http://www.riaa.com/default.asp" class="External">RIAA</a> artists, and B) I spend a good deal of money on artists that I like.  IndieTorrents has spurred me to buy many more CDs from artists that I would never have heard of.  So, stick that in your lawsuit-happy pipe and smoke it, RIAA.
</p>
<p>
In other news, <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" class="External">Pitchfork</a> seems to have <i>really</i> taken off this year.  Complete with industry scandal (their balance sheet was apparently leaked to the public), wide-acclaim and their own determined band of detractors.  The good news is that people are talking about them, and they remain one of the few bastions of real, no-kid-glove-wearing music journalism.  Yeah, sure, they can be real dicks and give <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/barman_paul/paullelujah.shtml" class="External">an album I really liked</a> a 2.0 out of 10, but that sort of opinionated music review gets me thinking about why I like the music so much.  To quote Jack Nicholson&#8217;s <i>Joker</i>: &#8220;<i>This town needs an enema!</i>&#8220;, and Pitchfork has provided as much.
</p>
<p>
So, without further ado, my top 10-ish albums that I heard for the first time this year (in no particular order):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Neutral Milk Hotel &#8211; <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/n/neutral-milk-hotel/in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea.shtml" class="External">In an Aeroplane Over The Sea</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../../../content/images/aeroplane.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>
From <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/578">an earlier post</a>: <i>The circuitous route by which Neutral Milk Hotel caught my ear is really only a small facet of the strange story of Jeff Mangum&#8217;s short career with his Neutral Milk Hotel band. In an Aeroplane&#8230; was released in 1998 to critical acclaim and then he essentially fell off the face of the earth. Much like the sudden rise subsequent disappearance of the band, both albums (this one and the first &#8220;On Avery Island&#8221;) are noisy, powerful and ultimately deep and terribly sad. There is part of me that wants to hear more and part of me that revels in the hope that music like that is never made again.</i>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Interpol &#8211; <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/i/interpol/antics.shtml" class="External">Antics</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../../../content/images/antics.gif" alt="antics album art" /><br />
<img src="../../../../content/images/carlos.jpg" alt="carlos d." /></p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve made a <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/316">couple</a> <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/303">posts</a> about Interpol in the past, mostly in regards to their breakout &#8220;Turn on the Bright Lights&#8221; album from 2002.  After a long wait in 2003 (and through most of 2004), they released &#8220;Antics&#8221;.  With &#8220;Turn on&#8230;&#8221;, the album grew on me with each listen, eventually becoming one of my favorite albums of 2003 and it still reminds me of the cold, dark winter of 2002/2003.  &#8220;Antics&#8221; hit me in a similar way, but different and better.  Interpol doesn&#8217;t shy away from their tight, rythmic ways on &#8220;Antics&#8221;, but do make many growing steps on this album.  Whereas once I thought &#8220;Turn on&#8230;&#8221; would be my favorite Interpol album, &#8220;Antics&#8221; has supplanted it.  &#8220;Slow Hands&#8221; the obvious favorite on the album shines (as much as these black-clad dudes can), and Carlos D.&#8217;s bass playing makes me want to shake my ass while Paul Bank&#8217;s dark vocals make me want to don black-on-black suits and sit in the corner.  It&#8217;s like hipster goth music, and I love it.

<h2>Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy &#8211; <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/billy_bonnieprince/master-and-everyone.shtml" class="External">Master and Everyone</a> / <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/billy_bonnieprince/i-see-a-darkness.shtml" class="External">I See A Darkness</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../../../content/images/master-and-everyone.gif" /><br />
<img src="../../../../content/images/i-see-a-darkness.gif" /></p>
<p>
My fandom of Will Oldham (Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy&#8217;s alter-ego) started when I first heard Palace Music&#8217;s &#8220;Viva Lost Blues&#8221; some two years ago.  The ragged vocals and broken-down guitar paired with superb lyrics hit a chord with me somehow, and I never stopped listening.  Bonnie Mr. Oldham has never been shy about releasing material, and he has a raft of it under various names.  So, when I kept hearing about this Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy album called &#8220;Master and Everyone&#8221; I had to check it out.  The ragged vocals of the Palace Music days were gone, and replaced with smooth (by Oldham standards) vocals and gracious harmonies.  Lyrically, he&#8217;s as tight (maybe tighter) than ever.  &#8220;The Way&#8221; gets me every time.  Also recommended: <a href="../../../../blog.html#">I See A Darkness</a>, also by the Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221;, and perhaps an even better album that &#8220;Master&#8221;.
</p>

<li>
<h2>Loretta Lynn &#8211; <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/l/lynn_loretta/van-lear-rose.shtml">Van Lear Rose</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../../../content/images/van-lear-rose.gif" alt="van lear rose" /></p>

If you would have told me January 1, 2004 that I would have selected a Loretta Lynn album in my &#8220;Best Music I Heard This Year&#8221; list, I would have dismissed you like a fifth grade class on the last day of classes.  But leave it to Mr. Jack White of the <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com" class="External">White Stripes</a> to pull together a young band to back Mrs. Lynn and crank out this awesome record.  However, you can&#8217;t give Jack all the credit here &#8212; Loretta Lynn has never been afraid of controversy or &#8220;pushing the envelope,&#8221; and suffice it to say that she might be a little cracked in the head.  Sometimes the best of them are, and she certainly doesn&#8217;t disappoint or go too far out of her boundaries.  She still sings songs about Butcher Holler, her mommy and hating on hussies, but with Jack&#8217;s raw production and a shitkicking band behind her she sounds way ahead of the country curve.  Take a lesson, Nashville.

<h2>DJ Danger Mouse &#8211; <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/d/danger-mouse/grey-album.shtml" class="External">The Grey Album</a></h2>

I&#8217;ve never, ever listened to a bit of Jay-Z.  I&#8217;ll freely admit that.  I have, however, like the good little white suburban kid that I am/was say that I listened to the Beatles&#8217; White Album quite a bit.  At first, I didn&#8217;t understand what all the hype was about DJ Danger Mouse&#8217;s mixing of the two albums.  I had easily dismissed Jay-Z as just another rapper, and thought that this might just be some half-assed attempt at party mixing.  Oh, how wrong I was.  After a couple of listens, I came to the realization that this <i>rocked</i>, and HARD.  Jay-Z&#8217;s tight lyrical stylings with the often beat-heavy semi-psychedelia of the White Album mingled nicely and brought new light to both albums.  Some folks said it was just fluff, and some said it was the coming of some sort of new style.  As per the usual, I can&#8217;t fall into either camp there &#8212; this isn&#8217;t bad enough to consider <i>just fluff</i>, but it&#8217;s no <i>White Album</i> by itself.  It is, however, a fantastic album that should draw fans of both genres together.  It&#8217;s just so damned fun and invigorating.  Few albums I can turn to regardless of mood or time of day.

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/devendrabanhart.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>
How to explain Devendra Banhart&#8230;  I don&#8217;t know if it can be done through words alone.  He&#8217;s got sort of that Eddie-Vedder-in-his-later-years thing going on with a touch of Will-Oldham-country-dirt but with a light and supple touch of Sufjan Stevens on the guitar.  I could attempt to put together any number of hipster name-drops to make a reasonable sculpture of Banhart, but the proof is in the listening.  He&#8217;s nearly 4 years younger than I, but writes and plays like a man twice his age.

TV on the Radio blends electronica, tape loops and even a smattering of a capella to make sonorous, infectious rap-inspired rock.  Rock might not be the right word here &#8212; perhaps <i>jams</i> is the better word.  They hit the scene this year with their debut, and if the new single &#8220;New Health Rock&#8221; is any indication, there are good things coming from TV on the Radio.

Ah, The Black Keys.  I&#8217;ve made a <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/361">couple</a> <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/323">posts</a> about these boys from Akron, Ohio.  They released &#8220;Rubber Factory&#8221; this year, after opening up in 2002 with &#8220;The Big Come Up&#8221;, which indeed was a big come-up for them.  I saw them in 2003 opening for Sleater-Kinney promoting their &#8220;Thickfreakness&#8221; album, which I thought was a lackluster sophomore effort.  &#8220;Rubber Factory&#8221;, however, proved me completely wrong by rocking their asses off.  These two guys are students of the real folk blues &#8212; having studied by playing with some of the best real blues performers.  They even passed up a number of offers to defect from their current label, <a href="http://fatpossum.com/" class="External">Fat Possum</a>, to larger, likely more lucrative deals.  I&#8217;ll agree that Stevie Ray Vaughan might have brought the blues back to the forefront in the 80&#8242;s, but people like the The  Black Keys keep them <i>alive</i>.

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/franz-ferdinand.gif" alt="ff" /></p>
<p>
I first heard Franz Ferdinand on <a href="http://www.woxy.com" class="External">WOXY</a> some months back with their first quirky single, &#8220;Darts of Pleasure&#8221;.  Later on, it was &#8220;Take Me Out&#8221;, then &#8220;Matinee&#8221;, and then &#8220;Michael&#8221;.  While listening to these singles months-apart, I hadn&#8217;t quite acquired my taste for Franz Ferdinand.  I had had other favorites over the span of my relationship with Franz, but by the time &#8220;Matinee&#8221; (one of the strongest tracks on an album of strong tracks) rolled around, I realized &#8220;Hey &#8212; wait a minute.  Each of these songs has been equally awesome!  Maybe the whole album is like this!&#8221;  Purchased at ear X-tacy sometime during the fall, it was true.  Franz Ferdinand, this band which I had a mere monthly fancy with had come home to roost at last.  They throw down the new-wave tinged hook-laden rock like no other Scots I know.  Expect good things.

<h2>Sufjan Stevens &#8211; <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/s/stevens_sufjan/michigan.shtml"  class="External">Greetings from Michigan</a> / <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/s/stevens_sufjan/seven-swans.shtml" class="External">Seven Swans</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../../../content/images/michigan.gif" alt="gfm" /><br />
<img src="../../../../content/images/seven-swans.gif" alt="ss" /></p>
<p>
By all accounts, Sufjan Stevens <i>should</i> have been on this list last year, if I had listened to <a href="http://www.lostinlouisville.com">Jackson</a> last year about Greetings From Michigan.  Sufjan Stevens is a unique and productive talent in the US indie scene &#8212; a gifted musician and songwriter who changes his style up a bit on each of his albums.  Greetings from Michigan is his epic love-song to the state of Michigan, and Seven Swans is a decidedly different record with a definite spiritual core.  It&#8217;s hard to say which I like more, I guess it depends on my mood.  Greetings has &#8220;Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head! (Rebuild! Restore! Reconsider!)&#8221;, a callout to the crumbling crown city of Michigan, which is both interesting in subject and in song.  Seven Swans has &#8220;The Dress Looks Nice on You&#8221;, which reminds me of Kelly so much &#8212; not only because of the lyrics, but because of the Casio-style breakdown later in the song.  Both albums I first listened to this year, so they get my double-vote.  <i>Further: Sufjan&#8217;s annual Christmas albums are fantastic turns on holiday standards.</i>

Pitchfork appears to be to blame for the explosion of this album.  It gets a 9.7 rating and everyone is hopping up and down excited like the Pixies got back together (they did, and people did hop up and down).  I&#8217;ve got this album, I&#8217;ve listened to it, and I <i>do</i> like it quite a bit, but not to the point that every indie hipster has put it on the top of their list!  I refuse to slag the album, because it&#8217;s certainly not slag-worthy, but <i>what the hell people</i>.

Brian Wilson &#8211; <a href="../../../../blog.html">SMiLE</a></p>
<p>
Pet Sounds is easily in my top ten <i>of all time</i>.  SMiLE is Brian Wilson&#8217;s long, long, long awaited release of the long, long, long awaited and long-shelved Beach Boys album.  I listened to it, and it is a masterful work, but not something that I felt deserved the <i>heaps</i> and <i>heaps</i> of rave reviews <i>heaped</i> upon it.  I love the guy just as much as the next Beach Boys fan, but he didn&#8217;t shit gold folks.  The album is playful, introspective, truly independent and a really <i>interesting</i> listen, though.  It&#8217;s worth finding out.

This album is so ridiculous, it is awesome.  If David Bowie had grown up in the eighties, you <i>know</i> this is what Ziggy Stardust would have ended up like.  It&#8217;s over-the-top, profanity-laced (<i>get your hands offa my woman, mother-chicken!</i>), and pulls out 80s heavy-metal tricks like so many rabbits from so many hats.  It&#8217;s my filthy music indulgence of the year, and I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit it.  So why all the hate, haters?  Can you not handle it?  Is the rock too much?  It is awesome and deep down inside, <i>you know it</i>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Summation&#8230;</h2>
<p>
So, what did I learn this year?  Well, you <i>can</i> mix up catchy bass-heavy new-wavy riffage with emo-style navel-gazing lyrics and turn out a great record (Interpol, and to a lesser extent Franz Ferdinand).  Also, there is nothing wrong with indie-rock singer-songwriters with a little old-timey flair (Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy, Sufjan Stevens, Devendra Banhart).  There is a lot of rap that I haven&#8217;t listened to, but should (Jay-Z, De La Soul, Mos Def, etc.), and some that might be in decline if you believe what you read (Beastie Boys).  There are many things I learned this year in music, but as per the usual, I learned that a little music leg-work is well worth it in the end.
</p>
<p>
After 2003&#8242;s nearly-non-stop White Stripes love-fest, I felt this year <i>turned it down a notch</i> in regards to my listening habits. Maybe it&#8217;s been happening for the last couple of years, but maybe it&#8217;s just a sign of the times.  My younger musical haunts of Nirvana and Rage Against the Machine have given way to softer, perhaps more <i>sophisticated</i> things such Sufjan Stevens and Will Oldham. This year brought more old-timey music to my ears, and made me reconsider my stance on <i>religiously-inspired</i> music.  There is still a <i>lot</i> of shitty religious music, but some of it &#8212; the more naked the better &#8212; is real gold.   Is it me?  Is it the world?  I&#8217;ve still got a taste for the rock, no doubt (Neutral Milk Hotel, Sonic Youth), but things that used to suit me don&#8217;t suit as well any more.  My tastes continue to change, and I look forward to more music in the new-year.

	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>That&#8217;s right, the capital &#8220;A&#8221; Audiophile in me made me reconsider how I rip CDs into the digital MP3 format.  At lunch today I did a little looking around at the current ripping/encoding systems available for the PC.  After a little deliberation, I have found that there are two tools that are considering the audiophile standard for digital music.  First is <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/" class="External">Exact Audio Copy</a> (EAC), a ripper that I find better than they venerable <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/">CDex</a>, due in part to EAC&#8217;s sophisticated error checking and error recovery methods.
</p>
<p>Further, I found that the choice encoder is (as it has always been) <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/" class="External">LAME</a> (LAME Isn&#8217;t an MP3 Encoder).  However, earlier this year someone tweaked version 3.90.3 of LAME for ever finer audio reproduction.  There are a couple of presets in LAME now called &#8220;Alt Presets&#8221;.  The most popular of these presets is &#8220;Alt Preset Standard&#8221;.  This makes a stereo, approximately 256kbps variable-bit-rate MP3 file of exquisite quality.  The filesize is a little larger over that of my previous modus-encoderi of stereo 192kbps constant-bit-rate, but the quality of the music is much better (at least in headphones).
</p>
<p>
I did a little comparative testing with my brand-spanking-new copy of <a href="http://www.interpolny.com/" class="External">Interpol</a>&#8216;s newest album, <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/i/interpol/antics.shtml" class="External">Antics</a>.  The results were, to my ears, astounding.  I&#8217;ve heard stereo 256kbps VBR and I ain&#8217;t going back!
</p>
<p>
On a side note, I should mention that <i>Antics</i> is a really awesome album &#8212; much like their previous hailed effort <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/303" class="External">Turn on the Bright Lights</a>, it might require a few listenings for it to sink in.  However, after it has sunk in, you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to not hum their solid rhythms to yourself, while secretly wishing it was snowing outside. File under: <i>Winter music</i>.</p>

<p>
Maybe the greatest &#8220;indie&#8221; band to rise out of the Derby City, <a href="http://www.southern.com/southern/band/SLINT/">Slint</a> were hailed as pioneers in their day.  They released two albums, <i>Tweez</i> and <i><a href="http://www.buymusichere.net/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=11&#038;upc=03617207642">Spiderland</a></i>, and in one way or another influenced a great number of bands here in Louisville, and helped to spark a great revival of Louisville&#8217;s indie scene.
</p>
<p>I think my first experience with Slint came from the soundtrack of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0113540/">Kids</a> (1995), the marvelous and chilling tale of a group of Kids in New York.  The Slint track on the album was what many would consider their signature track &#8211; &#8220;Good Morning, Captain&#8221;.  Trying to explain Slint is like trying to explain why I like looking at the sky at night.  You really just have to do it to appreciate it. Go and find some Slint (at least &#8220;Spiderland&#8221;) through whatever channels you deem ethical.</p>
<p>
So, anyway, back to the headline of this post &#8212; <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/04-10/12.shtml">Slint is re-forming</a>, starting at the first &#8220;<a href="http://www.atpfestival.com/">All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties</a>&#8221; festival in England next year.  I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll make it to Louisville some time and I hope I&#8217;m in the room when they play&#8230;</p>

Imagine if you will the sweet roughness of Will Oldham with the old touch of Marlene Dietrich.  Yeah.  Think about that.  Sparse arrangements, often just Devendra and guitar accent his odd and often beautiful and melancholy lyrics.  There is a waver in his voice that evoke the best of the old blues singers, but his phrasing is straight out of a 1940s cabaret  or a smoke-filled movie.

Again <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" class="External">Pitchfork</a> reports more good news for people who like the rock.  The <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com" class="External">White Stripes</a> are <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/04-07/09.shtml" class="External">readying a rarities album, among other things</a>.  Those other things include releasing the bootlegged and <i>awesome</i> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/johnpeel/index.shtml" class="External">John Peel sessions</a> they did (they have done two so far, and the first I literally listened to on a loop for a week back in 2001), as well as a DVD and possibly some back-catalog stuff from the &#8220;early days&#8221;.

<p>
According to an article at <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com">Pitchfork</a>, there is a <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/04-07/08.shtml#story3">book about Neutral Milk Hotel (a band) in the works</a>.  Oddly enough I just managed to <a href="http://www.indietorrents.com">get my hands on</a> their first album <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000019OD/102-9919184-7535357?v=glance">On Avery Island</a></i> just recently.  A few months back the venerable <a href="http://www.lostinlouisville.com">Mr. Cooper</a> implored me to listen to the positively riveting and <i>mind-blowingly awesome</i> second album <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000019PA/ref=cm_custrec_gl_acc/102-9919184-7535357?v=glance&#038;s=music">In an Aeroplane Over the Sea</a></i> after he himself was given a copy by a generous friend.</p>
<p>
The circuitous route by which <a href="http://www.neutralmilkhotel.net/">Neutral Milk Hotel</a> caught my ear is really only a small facet of the strange story of Jeff Mangum&#8217;s short career with his Neutral Milk Hotel band.  <i>In an Aeroplane&#8230;</i> was released in 1998 to critical acclaim and then he essentially fell off the face of the earth.  Much like the sudden rise subsequent disappearance of the band, both albums are noisy, powerful and ultimately deep and terribly sad.  There is part of me that wants to hear more and part of me that revels in the hope that music like that is never made again.  That said, I&#8217;d love to read more about it all&#8230;</p>

	    <p>
It would appear that <a href="http://www.woxy.com/" class="External">WOXY</a> will shortly be continuing it&#8217;s webcasting, according to an <a href="http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/06/17/biz_97x.html" class="External">article in the Cincinatti Enquirer</a> forwarded to me by long-time lurker (and Cinci resident) <a href="http://kmccarty.net/" class="External">Kevin McCarty</a> (sup Kev!).<br />
This is also backed up by <a href="http://www.woxy.com" class="External">WOXY</a>&#8216;s frontpage.
</p>
<p>To quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Kind fate has sent us two dedicated listeners with the vision and courage to step up as partners to fund the continued broadcast of 97X The Future of Rock and Roll over the Internet.</p>
<p>These magnanimous folks want to remain anonymous, but they feel passionately about &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221; and &#8220;doing good work,&#8221; and we are the lucky recipients of their generous spirit.</p>
<p>Like Phoenix rising from the ashes, 97X &#8211; just as we have always loved it &#8211; will be returning soon. It will take us a few weeks to get set up for the future, but be assured that Mike and Barb and Shiv and Bryan Jay are already hard at work to bring it all back.</p>
<p>Keep checking woxy.com for updates &#8230; we&#8217;ll announce an air date just as soon as we know it.</p>
<p>Give a little shout of thanks to our &#8220;angels&#8221; &#8211; and stay tuned!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome!</p>
