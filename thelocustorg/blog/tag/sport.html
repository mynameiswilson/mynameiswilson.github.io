<p>That&#8230; was&#8230; awesome!!!  We made it to the game and back and it was totally awesome.  An amazing experience, the whole thing.  70,000 raving mad fans totally into every minute of the game &#8211; unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever experienced.  Our seats were much better than I thought they&#8217;d be!  We were 3 rows behind the right hand side of the goal box.  FC Barçelona rolled over Zaragosa 4-1 and it was great fun.  The train ride back was interesting &#8211; so packed with people, and then we had just missed the Red Line train that would have connected us back near our hotel, so we had to hoof it 10 blocks or so.  A nice walk, though &#8211; moonlit night with dinner patrons rollling home.</p>
<p>Photos are slowly upping now.  Went to L&#8217;Aquarium Barçelona this AM &#8211; a fantastic &#8220;shark tunnel&#8221; with a slow moving sidewalk.  Kinda like Newport &#8211; but with more and bigger sharks.  Also a good penguin exhibit and a ray tank.  Good stuff!  Rays are fun.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: we&#8217;ll finish up our gift shopping and generally roam around the city, getting our last sights, sounds and flavors before heading home on Friday.  Did I mention we&#8217;ve been keeping copious notes on our comings and goings, and will be publishing them online after we get back?  Yeah, I&#8217;ll be doing that.  There are a lot of things I would have liked to have known before I got here &#8211; my gift will be unto the Internets.  Enjoy!</p>

	    <p> This just in!  We scored FC Barcelona tickets for tomorrow night versus Zaragosa from a couple of old gents scalping outside of Camp Nou.  A lot of finger pointing, gestures and calculators&#8230;  Checking the FCB website, I think we did pretty well.  Excited to see our second-ever football match and our first-ever European one.  Spent most of the day today at the National Art Museum (we did the full run of it today) &#8211; the bike tour was a wash, only one other couple was there, so we decided to skip it.  Aquarium tomorrow before the 10PM game. YAAAAY.</p>
<p>A little more on the National Art Museum &#8211; spent a lot of time today in the Romanic collection of early Christian art.  A fantastic collection of 11th, 12th, 13th century art from early churches.  Many partial walls restored to their original positions (&#8220;in situ&#8221; as it&#8217;s known) to give you an idea of the size and scale of the places that housed them. A wonderful way to step into the shoes of someone 1000 years ago&#8230;</p>
<p>Dinner at a vegetarian falafel joint called Maoz.  Great, cheap stuff right on the Ramblas.  Excellent pitas with a &#8220;buffet lliure&#8221; (open buffet) with delicious things like beets, pickled carrots, olives, tabbouleh, sauces, etc.  A crazy local stuck his head in the bar and started hawking &#8220;MARIJUANA!!&#8221;.  Hilarious.  Dub music played, backpackers strolled by, etc.</p>

Kelly shot me a text message today that said it all:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
i has a blog
</p></blockquote>
<p>
She&#8217;s been kicking around the idea of doing an Ironman Triathlon for a while now &#8211; and she was a volunteer for the <a href="http://ironman.com/louisville" class="External">Louisville Ironman</a> that was held last weekend.   She&#8217;s been really struggling with whether she should do it or not, especially after working the medical tent and seeing what people look like after some 16 hours of physical exertion.  It&#8217;s pretty intense!  But, oddly at the same time the Ironman is very, very seductive.
</p>
<p>
I wandered down to the finish line on Sunday and it was extremely exciting and worse still &#8211; inspiring!  Families cheering on their athletes, people breaking down into tears upon finishing, people collapsing into the arms of the legion of volunteers.  I&#8217;ve been to marathons before and have completed a half-marathon, but I&#8217;ve never, <em>ever</em> seen anything on this level of commitment before.  And now, it would seem, Kelly is leaning towards doing it&#8230; and that scares me a little.</p>
<p>
Kelly and I have done &#8220;sprint&#8221; triathlons- .5 mile swim, 14 mile bike, 3 mile run &#8211; and those are OK.  We both finish in under 2 hours.  But an Ironman is something completely different.  2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and a full marathon &#8211; 26 miles!  The time cutoff is about 17 hours.  That&#8217;s longer than most people are awake on any given day.
</p>
<p>
Kelly&#8217;s other option is to do a half-Ironman distance, which I personally think is a better choice, given her relatively short experience with triathlons &#8211; but you know you can&#8217;t keep Kelly down when it comes to being healthy.  It&#8217;s a special kind of crazy, I think.
</p>
<p>
Whatever her decision, you can track Kelly&#8217;s progress here: <a href="http://wannatrisome.blogspot.com">Wanna Tri Some?</a>

<em>Oh, hey, how are you?!  Haven&#8217;t seen you &#8217;round the Fat Burger in a while, maaaan&#8230; I heard you been hangin&#8217; round with those dudes!</em>
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t know what all that&#8217;s about, but yeah dang I been busy as of late.  I&#8217;ve got to set down this load in digi-print, so here goes &#8211;  I&#8217;ve got all sorts of stuff going down in town:
</p>
<p>
I helped to develop and launch a thing for GE called <a href="http://www.sharekitchenconfessions.com" class="External">Confessions from the Kitchen</a> with my Flash guy <a href="http://www.ae4rv.com">Geoff</a>.  Real interesting project, that (in the &#8220;saying&#8221; sense of the word).
</p>
<p>
Also, I trained for and ran the <a href="http://www.derbyfestivalmarathon.com/" class="External">Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon</a> (13.1 miles).  I had this crazy idea that I could do it in 2 hours, and by some aligning of fates, I did it.  2 hours, 35 seconds.  I never, ever could have done it without the determination and love of my lady KELLY.  I owe her a lot for getting me to that point.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve also been a model-building <em>fool</em> this winter.  I built an Apogee handlaunch plane (my first-ever bagged wing), finished my <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/wind-dancer/" class="External">Wind Dancer electric sailplane</a>, built and flew a <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/redwing/" class="External">Redwing electric wing</a>, built an <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/xp-5/" class="External">XP-5 discus-launched glider</a>, and am currently finishing up a prototype discus-launched glider for <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Denny @ Polecat</a>.
</p>
<p>
Delving deeper into my R/C soaring passion, I&#8217;ve been tapped to write the <a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/events/natsnews.asp" class="External">NATS News</a> coverage for the soaring events at the 2007 AMA/LSF Nationals!  I&#8217;d apparently impressed a few people when I did <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/747">my coverage of the World Soaring Masters</a> back in September.  I&#8217;ll be writing daily articles and shooting photos.  Really excited about that!
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I&#8217;ve signed up to tow F3J at the NATS this year!  F3J is a class of soaring event that is internationally recognized, and there are &#8220;World Championships&#8221; held every two years.  While most of soaring is an individual affair, F3J a team effort requiring a manager, pilots, callers (people who tell the pilots what is going on) and towmen, who actually pull the plane up into the sky.  The 2007 League of Silent Flight / AMA Nationals in Muncie (aka &#8220;the NATS&#8221;) is hosting an F3J competition this year, and I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of it.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll also be travelling in June to the <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/polecat-challenge-2007/" class="External">2007 Polecat Challenge</a>, one of the best handlaunch soaring competitions in the country!  And currently, I&#8217;m trying to aid Bruce Davidson in his attempt to claim <a href="http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=666241" class="External">the highest handlaunch in the world</a>!
</p>
<p>
Continuing the aviation theme, my brother (who recently served OJ Simpson twice in one week at his restaurant, because <a href="http://www.whas11.com/topstories/stories/050907whasrtTopOJTossed.5014ed1b.html" class="External">some people just don&#8217;t care for OJ</a>) and I took my dad up to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum up in Dayton, Ohio for his sixtieth birthday (May 6th)!  I love that place, and we all had a good time&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Did I mention I&#8217;m coaching the softball team at Power Creative?  How nuts is that?!  Our first practice is TONIGHT.
</p>
<p>
I <em>need</em> to get things done!</p>

	    <blockquote><div>
&#8230;It&#8217;s me you see with the funk in my walk.
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Kelly and I ran the <a href="http://www.ymcalouisville.org" class="External">Northeast YMCA Thanksgiving Day Fun Run</a> on Thursday.  It&#8217;s a 10K (6.2 miles), but they have you guess at the distance at the end, so it&#8217;s never exactly 6.2 miles.  It was the longest I&#8217;ve ever run in my entire life, and I was not being chased by a bear.
</p>
<blockquote><div>
You gotta keep movin&#8217; and you can&#8217;t say nothing<br/><br />
I&#8217;m a keep bouncin&#8217; and bumpin&#8217; and stuffin&#8217;
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, what then is the reason for the lyrics to the Beastie Boys&#8217; <i>The Maestro</i> sprinkled about here?  That was the song that came over the iPod strapped to my arm exactly halfway through the race.  Never let the power of music to compel be a mystery to you.  I&#8217;ve got this <i>thing</i>, you see, wherein I defeat myself the first half of the run, wondering just what <i>the hell</i> I am doing out there in the cold, nose all running and snotty.  I beat myself down and consider stopping many times.
</p>
<p>
But then the yelling starts.  <i>In my brain.</i>  I am yelling at myself that I am weak and it is evident I will never finish.  I think this is some sort of reverse-psychology play being acted out (or perhaps just directed or produced) by my hypothalamus as a survival instinct.  In any case, this rarely works to much satisfaction.  So then the only thing can save me is a good song with a beat to which I can pound pavement.  Enter <i>The Maestro</i>.
</p>
<blockquote><div>
Yeeeeaaaaaaaah you mother fuckers I am all that. <br/><br />
I see you looking at me saying &#8220;How can he be so skinny but live so phat?&#8221; <br/><br />
You know why?<br/><br />
&#8230;cause I&#8217;m The Maestro.
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
For those of you who know the song, that first line in all it&#8217;s filthy glory is <i>the</i> call-out in an album filled with awesome call-outs.  It&#8217;s a rallying cry heard the world round.  The Beastie Boys are back and are not to be meddled with.  In short: <i>damn</i>.  I then proceed to sprint (or at least what constitutes a sprint) the next mile or so, buoyed with that sort of <i>hell yeah</i> spirit so embodied in the song.
</p>
<p>
The problem, however, is that <i>The Maestro</i> is only three minute long.  At this point in the race, I&#8217;m at something like 28 minutes in, with another 28 to go.   Luckily, the iPod knows this all too well and kicks in another excellent <i>brainpan-shattering song</i>, the all-to-undervalued and under-played Black Sabbath tune <i>Supernaut</i>.  All alone on the course, between the masses that seem to form during a race, it&#8217;s all too fitting:
</p>
<blockquote><div>
Got no religion, dont need no friends<br/><br />
Got all I want and I dont need to pretend<br/><br />
Dont try to reach me, cause I&#8217;d tear up your mind<br/><br />
I&#8217;ve seen the future and Ive left it behind
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Couple that with a certifiably <i>fierce</i> hook and the acoustic <i>bad-assery</i> that occurs near the end of the song and you&#8217;ve got metal brilliance.  When my ashes are fired into space, this song will be played. (Followed shortly by <i>The Wizard</i>).
</p>
<p>
In the end, I managed to keep my time under an hour (56 minutes and change) and I felt good.  Kelly was proud of me, and I was proud of me as well.  All thanks to <i>The Maestro</i>.</p>

<p>
Chalk it up to pre-mid-life crises if you will, but I recently have been enjoying biking quite a bit.  I bought my first &#8220;real&#8221; bike a few months back (a <a href="http://konaworld.com/shopping_cart/FrontEnd/Products/product_detail.aspx?productid=344&#038;parentid=253" class="External">Kona Smoke</a>) for commuting purposes, and it has served me very well.  Kelly and I rode Mayor Jerry&#8217;s Hike &#038; Bike on Labor day and while there I noticed folks in <a href="http://www.kymba.org" class="External">KY Mountain Biking Association</a> jerseys.  I guess I never really considered trail riding until that moment.  I knew such things existed around town, considering our excellent <a href="http://www.louisvilleky.gov/metroparks" class="External">Metro Parks</a> system, and generally hilly terrain.  My bike is essentially a converted mountain bike frame with slicker wheels, but would still be up to the task.  Why not?!
</p>
<p>
Tuesday evening, with no one to play soccer with at the park, I decided to check out the <a href="http://kymba.org/trails/trail.php?id=51" class="External">Wilderness Trail Loop</a>, a well-maintained beginner-level trail just south of Seneca Park on Old Cannons Lane.  Not really knowing if my bike &#8211; or even <i>I</i> were up to it, I climbed up the trailhead and started on my merry way.
</p>
<p>
If there was a squirrel watching me as I flew down the trail, he&#8217;d have seen a man  eyes wide with wonderment and a smile to match.  It&#8217;s been a long time since I had this much fun on a bike.</p>

<p>Hey all!  Just thought I&#8217;d give you a postcard from <em>the road</em>!  Kelly and I let out of Louisville on Thursday night.  We made good time (even stopping by an outlet mall where Kelly exercised amazing discipline both in purchase and in efficiency) and got to the <a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org" class="External">Academy of Model Aeronautics</a> site with enough time to set up the tent in the light.  We were, however, surprised, to find a troop of Boy Scouts in the camping area when we arrived.  No problems, though &#8212; it actually made me reminiscent of <em>my</em> scouting days.</p>
<p>Friday was Handlaunch day at the NATS, and the weather was crap &#8211; which means it was great for a contest!  Windy and overcast, it had rained the first night a bit, and it threatened to do so the whole day.  Thermal activity was boiling in the morning, but it quickly dissapated into what I think was some sort of low-level temperature inversion (think of it as a &#8220;cap&#8221; on the field) and thermalling was rough.  Ed Franz, the contest director, loves to punish the handlaunch competitors, and the tasks were *real* long.  One wrong move or one missed thermal and *pow* you were out of there!  I flew pretty well during the middle of the day, but I really fell apart at the end of the day, and ended up in 9th out of 19.  My buddy Bruce Davidson flew to 2nd place and fellow LASS-mate Ken Marks ended up in 15th.  I&#8217;ll do better in Unlimited on Wednesday/Thursday and then in RES on Friday, right?</p>
<p>Friday night was rain, rain, rain and our tent has some leakage issues, so we were a little damp.  Despite that, Saturday was beautiful and I hung around with &#8220;<a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Team Polecat</a>&#8221; as they bucked the trends and flew a 60&#8243; ship in an event that usually calls for planes that are 160&#8243; in wingspan.   Kelly and I split around 2PM for Detroit, making a stop in Fort Wayne at their <a href="http://www.hm.com" class="External">H&amp;M</a> store.</p>
<p><img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/16136-2/20060723-detroit-03-kelly_claw.jpg" class="FloatLeft" /></p>
<p>Today we went to a <a href="http://www.detroittigers.com" class="External">Detroit Tigers</a> game, and had a blast!  The weather has been very mild (low 80&#8242;s ) and a nice breeze was occassionally around.  Kelly got to see her beloved &#8220;Pudge&#8221; Rodriguez, and we both enjoyed a day at the ballpark.</p>
<p>This evening, we headed out to another <a href="http://www.hm.com" class="External">H&amp;M</a> store in Ann Arbor, and then drove north up State street to the University of Michigan area.  What a cool little town up there!  We walked around for a few hours and ate sushi and ice cream.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <a href="http://www.hfmgv.org" class="External">the Henry Ford</a>!

	    <p><em>Update 4: Technology Fails Us, Kelly Finishes Despite it all!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051009chicago/"><br />
<img class="FloatLeft" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/12787-2/20051009_chicago_13_yarthissucks.jpg" alt="stuck on train" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>So, after the Damen Avenue stop, I headed back down the Blue Line to transfer to the Red Line at Jackson Station.  <em>And then things got hairy.</em> Packed trains and we sat on the tracks for a good 15-20 minutes waiting for the platform to clear &#8212; I assume this is so that people won&#8217;t be sucked onto the electrified tracks.   Anyway, I last saw Kelly at approximately 10:44 AM at the 15 mile marker.  The next vantage was at Chinatown/Cermak station at the 21.5 mile marker, approximately 1 hour of Kelly-time away (11:45).  I was sitting on the train when I assumed Kelly would have passed the Chinatown stop, so I went on to the Sox/35th station, which turned out to be the best viewing anyway &#8212; and about 95% less the people.  Awesome.   <em>Despite that good fortune</em> I did not see Kelly.  I got there about 11:50 and stayed until 12:15, sure in the idea that Kelly had slipped by my wily gaze.  I don&#8217;t know if she did or not, but I captured a photo of Comiskey Park. Dejected, I headed back down the Red Line to Roosevelt Station and the finish line.  Expecting a  notification on my phone when she passed 40k (as I had gotten a 10k, half-way (21k) and a 30k notification) I thought either Kelly had been eaten by bears or technology had failed us!  Oh dear oh dear.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051009chicago/"><br />
<img class="FloatRight" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/12772-2/20051009_chicago_18_bensign.jpg" alt="Signage" /><br />
</a><br />
Realizing the absolute throng of people in the park at the finish, I decided to head down past the finish to the &#8220;Reunion Stations&#8221;, at our pre-planned &#8220;Q&#8221; for &#8220;Quincy&#8221; meet-up.  What a goddamned HUDDLED MASS of people!  I was in <em>human</em> stand-still traffic for about 15 minutes.  Insanity.  Thank god I&#8217;m not claustrophobic.  I would have been instantly melted (while the &#8220;Married with Children&#8221; theme went through my head, as the Buckingham Fountain was always within site.  20 minutes later, Kelly spotted my sign and we had a sweaty, achy reunion.  5 minutes later my phone pinged me to say Kelly had crossed the finish line at 4 hours,  50 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/200510chicago/20051009chicago/"><br />
<img class="FloatLeft" src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/12766-2/20051009_chicago_21_thefinisher.jpg" alt="Winner!" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Off to the hotel!  Where we are immediately told that our reservations have been cancelled!  <em>Cancelled!</em> Woe is technology!  Woe is us!  Kelly immediately gets her &#8220;stern voice&#8221; on telling the embattled front-desk agent Ahmad that &#8220;our credit cards have already been charged&#8221;.  Long story short, Expedia was called, a FAX was exchanged and now we&#8217;re reserved <em>in the computer</em> and that means we&#8217;re golden &#8212; virtually.  However, there were a crapload of people who checked out late due to the marathon, so we are waiting on a king bed to be cleaned.  And here we sit.</p>
<p>PS &#8212; Ever seen that old SNL sketch &#8220;Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  Pepsi!&#8221; about the Greek guys running a grill?  <em>IT IS HERE IN THE HOTEL I SWEAR IT</em>.  Replete with Greeks! (Maybe Armenians, Mediterraneans in any case).  I will eat here every day and order a cheeseburger and Pepsi (they actually carry Pepsi) even if I&#8217;m not hungry.</p>
<p><em>Update 3: Malcolm X Supplemental!</em></p>
<p>Just saw Kelly and Howard at corner of Jackson and Damen.  Both looked good and were right on time for their pace &#8212; looks like they are at about 10 minute pace.  Next stop: Cermak/Chinatown at the 21.5 mile marker. They should arrive about 11:45 or a little after.</p>
<p><em>Update #2: 10:24 AM CST Location: Malcolm X College Lawn, Jackson and Damen Streets.  Wireless Strength: Excellent.</em></p>

<p>Last saw Kelly at Cornelia and Broadway in Wrigleyville around the 8 mile marker.  Both she and Howard were responsive and ambulatory!  Even had a chance to wave and smile.  Awesome.  Got notification that they had passed 10k (6.2miles) at 1:13, which is right on target.</p>
<p>I went back to Addison Station on the Red Line, boarded a packed train headed to Jackson Station.  Transferred to Blue Line, got off at Medical Center stop.  Good vantage point here, right at the turn onto Jackson, which leads runners back into the city.</p>
<p>Just now received word via email that Kelly has passed the halfway point! Huzzah!  <em>Kelly,Wilson,02:24:25.00 @ Halfway</em> They actually picked up a little speed here!  Halfway is about 21k.</p>
<p><em>Update #1: 8:57 AM CST.  Location: <a class="External" href="http://maps.google.com/local?hl=en&amp;q=3500+North+Halsted+chicago%2C+il+60657&amp;btnG=Search">Caribou Coffee, 3500 N Halsted Ave, Wrigleyville</a></em></p>

Kelly and I met up with Howard and Harry (also from Louisville) this AM on Congress Avenue at about 7AM. Not as cold as we had expected, and the high should only reach about 70 degrees today.  Good weather for running (so I&#8217;m told).</p>

I stuck around with Kelly until about 7:35 or so, and walked with her up to about the 10-minute pace mark in the starting queue.  This thing is hugeness on a level I&#8217;ve rarely experienced before!  I don&#8217;t actually intend on seeing Kelly until the finish (we are meeting at the &#8220;Q&#8221; meetup station.  Our last name is &#8220;Quincy&#8221; if anyone asks).   So, I took the L back up to the Addison (Wrigleyville) station and hiked a few blocks up to this coffee house to do an update.  It&#8217;s pretty close to the 8 mile marker, where hopefully the crowd will have thinnned out a little bit and I can catch a glimpse of Kelly.  Hard to say, tho&#8217;.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Howard tells us that his last run he took before leaving Louisville provided a good omen!  He has a route he runs that is normally 3 miles or so &#8212; but he took a bit of a detour, and when he got back home and checked his handy-dandy pedometer-watch thing, it read 2.62 miles!  (26.2 being the distance of the marathon).  Awesome!</p>
<p><em>More later!</em></p>

A co-worker of mine, who dresses <i>fabulously</i> informed me that local Italian eatery <i><a href="http://www.louisvillehotbytes.com/melillos.shtml" class="External">Melillo&#8217;s</a></i> is considering starting up a bocce league of some sort.  It&#8217;s sort of gelling right now &#8212; and I&#8217;d say the time is <b>nigh</b> for such developments!  Melillo&#8217;s already has a bocce pit behind their restaurant, so why not start a league there?
</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/bocceballs.jpg" alt="bocce" class="FloatRight" /></p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t know why bocce hasn&#8217;t &#8220;caught on&#8221; around town &#8211; it really is a &#8220;sport&#8221; that can be done anywhere.  <a href="http://www.4ourthgate.com" class="External">Cholly</a> and I regularly play in the gravel parking lot here at work!   Also, it is a sport conducive to drinking (after all, the Italians did invent it).  Bocce ball in one hand, glass of wine or pint of beer in the other!  Fantastico!

<p>Kelly ran her first-ever triathlon today.  Each year since 1981, the <a class="External" href="http://www.state.ky.us/agencies/parks/events/eprun-body.htm">E. P. Tom Sawyer State Park Triathlon</a> has been run  (not surprisingly) at lovely E. P. Tom Saywer Park.  The first leg is the swim, which was 800 meters.  The registration required an estimation of how fast you could swim this to &#8220;seed&#8221; you and give you a start time.  Kelly said &#8220;24 minutes&#8221;.  What she actually did in the pool this morning was something closer to 15 or 16 minutes!  Crazy.  She was passing people left and right.</p>
<p>After the swim is a 14 mile bike ride, and Kelly&#8217;s toughest  leg, at least she thought it would be.  Turns out she was wrong on that, too!  She finished that in just about an hour, with no mishaps, spills, or terrible accidents causing her feet to be permanently trapped in her toe-clips.</p>
<p>The final leg was a 5k (3.1 mile) run, which she completed smiling and &#8220;feeling great&#8221;.  Total time: 1 hour 50 minutes.  Not  bad for her first ever!  She&#8217;s hyped for future triathlons.  &#8220;I wish I would have started this stuff sooner,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;m terribly proud of my lil&#8217; Kelly.  Despite all her fears, she really kicked ass out there today.  If you&#8217;d like to see pictures, I suggest you check the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20040807triathlon">2004.08.07 &#8211; Triathlon gallery</a>.</p>
