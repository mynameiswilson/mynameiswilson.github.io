<p>Crossed into New Mexico a few miles back &#8212; we are now in I-40.  We let<br />
out of the hotel at about 9:30 this morning, with the intention of hitting<br />
an IHOP (Int&#8217;l House of Pancakes), an eatery neither of us had had the<br />
pleasure of frequenting.  Might I say &#8212; they do have tasty pancakes.  I<br />
had some &#8220;Country Griddle Cakes&#8221;, which were essentially normally pancakes<br />
with Cream of Wheat in them.  Wow.  Tasty stuff, that.  With strawberries<br />
and whipped topping, well&#8230;. </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020430honeymoon"><br />

</a></p>
<p>I really hadn&#8217;t remembered Oklahoma City for the bombing 7 years ago<br />
(exactly 2 weeks and a day past seven years today), but Kelly asked &#8220;are<br />
we going to see the memorial?&#8221;, and so we did.  Oklahoma City is<br />
remarkably easy to navigate, as there isn&#8217;t much to the city.  Flatty<br />
McFlat, it is.  Anyway, we got off I-235 to visit the memorial, and it is<br />
quite striking.  Two walls stand on either side of a constantly moving,<br />
yet still, lake of water.  The left wall is marked 9:01, the right, 9:03.<br />
The bomb went off at 9:02, ending the lives of 168 men, women and<br />
children.  The memorial is set between what is left of the foundation of<br />
the now-gone Murrow Federal Building, one side of the foundation showing<br />
rebar and cracked concrete.  If you stand on the spot where the van was<br />
parked, behind you is a single, gnarled tree.  This gnarled tree has<br />
become the symbol of the memorial, its stylized outline the official logo.<br />
On the sides of the memorial are tacked innumerable tributes to the<br />
victims, friends and family lost in the attack.  Some of the tributes are<br />
quite moving &#8212; poetry, pictures, etc.  Some are bizarre.  This is just<br />
me, but &#8220;Hello Kitty&#8221; paraphenilia just shouldn&#8217;t be there.  Kelly and I<br />
took pictures, and then we hit I-235 to I-40 and got the hell out of<br />
Dodge.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I drove the stretch between Oklahoma City and Amarillo.  In the space of a<br />
couple of a hundred miles, the land goes from somewhat flat to<br />
awe-inducing flat.  The sky opens up and the clouds part.  The wind in<br />
Texas is quite possibly insane.  Also, there are signs mentioning that<br />
&#8220;Hitchhikers may be escaping inmates&#8221;.  Note to self: if in OKC prison,<br />
break out, but make sure you hitchhike BEFORE THE SIGNS.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020430honeymoon"><br />

</a></p>
<p>Exit 112, I-40, Groom, TX.  The Western Hemispheres tallest cross.  You<br />
can see this thing for miles. However, in Texas, you can see EVERYTHING<br />
for miles.  This cross is huge, though.  5 stories or something.  Whee.</p>
<p>Also, whilst moseying through Texas, we kept seeing signs for &#8220;FREE 72oz<br />
STEAK!&#8221;.  72oz = 4.5 lbs.  Thats a LOT of steak.  As we neared &#8220;The Big<br />
Texan&#8221; restaurant (which lies in Amarillo), the signs clarified that in<br />
fact, you had to eat the whole thing in an hour to get it for free.  How<br />
many men must die to satisfy the Big Texan?!  The Big Texan is a horrid,<br />
horrid and yet alluring restaurant.  Giant fiberglass cattle perch outside<br />
&#8211; stoic guardians of their own beef.  The restaurant itself is BRIGHT<br />
yellow, and dolled up like a two dollar whore.  Lassos, boots, ten-gallon<br />
hats are par for the course on that one.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The driving switch off occurred in a little town called Vega, Texas.  It&#8217;s<br />
the halfway point on Route 66 (which I44 and I40 are part of), by the way.<br />
We pull into the local Dairy Queen (a serendipitous happening, no less),<br />
and had some lunch.  Everything in the store is &#8220;TexaSized&#8221;.  The medium<br />
drinks are larges back home.  Dairy Queen apparently has a Texas only<br />
menu.  They served TACOS here.  TACOS at a DAIRY QUEEN.  Genius.  Mad, mad<br />
genius.  The wind is blowing very hard.  Kelly and I sit on a guardrail<br />
and watch as quite possibly the most beautiful sky i&#8217;ve ever seen roll<br />
overhead.   The locals milled about, talking about the weather and other<br />
things, and it occured to Kelly that this was, in fact, yet another<br />
X-Files town.  Must&#8230; leave&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020430honeymoon"><br />

</a></p>
<p>The driving switch done, we head back out on the road.  It only took 4<br />
hours from OKC to Vega, which is excellent time.  We will be passing<br />
through Tucumcari, NM on our way to Albuquerque.  Apparently, there is a<br />
very good art museum there with quite an O&#8217;Keefe collection.  Sounds good<br />
to me (and David, thanks for the tip!)</p>
<p>We are about a day ahead of our &#8220;schedule&#8221;, so we may take an alternate<br />
route home, as Oklahoma sucked so bad.  At least Texas is pretty, and New<br />
Mexico has nice rocks.  Oklahoma just sucks.  </p>

<p>So far, we&#8217;ve covered about 1400 mis on our journey across the US.  This<br />
is really a blast, even if we are in the car a lot.  </p>
<p>Oh, and if my mother should read this &#8212; when i mentioned &#8220;i hope to find<br />
some $25-$30 hotels to stay at&#8221;, and the entire extended family erupted in<br />
laughter at my ASSUMED naivete, well IN YOUR FACE, BUHRMANS!  We stayed at<br />
a comfy $30 Travelodge last night, and the hotel in Albuquerque shall<br />
prove the same!  Yes, the hotel in St. Louis was $50, but there was a big<br />
soccer tourney in town.</p>
<h2>9:25PM Red Roof Inn, I-40 exit 155, Albuquerque NM</h2>
<p>Papa johns pizza in bed. ahhh..  the sky is nothing short of HUGE out<br />
here.  Albuquerque is on the otherside of a picturesque little range of<br />
mountains on I-40.  Shrouded in a little big of haze because of some fires<br />
burning out in the plains, though.  Again, we have found a $35 hotel room.<br />
This time &#8212; two queen beds!  Well, i can deal with that!</p>
<p>Tomorrow &#8211; Albuquerque Museums, Grand Canyon</p>

<p>As i type this, we are whizzing along US60, between Billings and<br />
Marionville.  We are on our way to Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The trip down from<br />
St. Louis went pretty quick &#8212; our average speed, 72 mph.  The speed limit<br />
is 70 on parts of I-44 from St. Louis to Springfield, which is nice.<br />
Traffic is light.    There seem to be a lot of farms dealing in exotic<br />
animals out here.  Zebras, camels, dromedary, llamas.  Perhaps it is just<br />
to supply Branson, MO which is to the south.  A couple of disturbing<br />
roadsigns for the &#8220;Shoji Show with Christina and Donna&#8221;.  Shoji is Shoji<br />
the Entertainer, but looks more like Emo Phillips, except of Asian<br />
heritage.  Also, we attempted to find the &#8220;Hempatorium&#8221;,  apparently some<br />
sort of gigantic store of hemp goods (located right next to a Wal-Mart).<br />
Our attempts failed, and hopefully we can find it on the way back.
</p>

<p>We just passed the Marionville city limit &#8212; population 2,417.  I should<br />
mention that we had already been through Marionville, but headed back to<br />
Billings to get something to eat.  Not surprisingly, the eatery of choice<br />
is Dairy Queen.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that normally, i don&#8217;t get seasick in cars, but<br />
the combination of typing, and the REALLY, REALLY hilly roads of MO T<br />
(missouri route T, they seem to use some sort of non-sequential alpha<br />
numeric system here), are getting me a little ill.  It is seriously like<br />
some sort of amusement ride.  Whee!  BLLLLLAAARG!  Jesus, it just doesn&#8217;t<br />
stop.  And, in western tradition, the endless ribbon of road stretches out<br />
before you, except all you see is crest after crest of vomit inducing<br />
road.  Please, Poseidon, end this interminable sickness.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020429honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7018-2/04290016_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Okay, so earlier we went to Marionville.  Marionville is a perfect small<br />
little town.  A tiny little center, and a little tiny post office.  (I&#8217;d<br />
like to note that we just turned left off of MO T, and somehow, despite<br />
our 90 degree turn to the left, the road continues on it&#8217;s Six-Flagsian<br />
crest and valley adventure.  The chicken in my stomach has had about<br />
enough.  I just burped up Chicken Jimmy Hoffa, and he says they are about<br />
to walk out).  So, on with Marionville.  Plenty of little cross-streets,<br />
and a spattering of White Squirrel-themed adverts and businesses.  Even<br />
the Marionville Wellness Clinic has the stoic visage of a white squirrel.<br />
I really wanted the &#8220;Heart of Fire&#8221; Baptist Church with a little squirrel<br />
with a crown of thorns or something.  I didn&#8217;t get it.  Onto our squirrel<br />
hunt.  We drove around for about 1/2 hour looking for these little<br />
buggers.  We drove on South Street, Fiske, Washington, and North Streets.<br />
The Middle School.  The High School.  Few squirrels to be found.  Then &#8211;<br />
squirrel strike!  Damn, only a normal squirrel.  We pose in front of<br />
&#8220;White Squirrel Hollow&#8221;, which appears to be a bed and breakfast, or your<br />
crazy old grandmothers house.  Kelly poses in front of the sign.  No<br />
squirrels attack.  Kelly notes that this looks like a town out of the X<br />
Files.  I remember that episode where people worship this little worm that<br />
is their &#8220;god&#8221;, but lives in the neck of a sacrifical human.  I really<br />
wanted the mayor of the town to be chosen by the squirrels, and whomever<br />
was &#8220;chosen&#8221; by these &#8220;squirrels&#8221; would be inhabited by no less than three<br />
squirrels.  Sort of giant-robot/Voltron/Gundam style.  One listens (&#8220;the<br />
information officer&#8221;), one speaks and drives (&#8220;the captain&#8221;) and the other<br />
one keeps the heart beating (&#8220;the engineer&#8221;).  A squirrelish mayor,<br />
controlling the meek and scared townsfolk.  Yeah. </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020429honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/6990-2/04290002_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatRight" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>So, back to the squirrel hunt.  As we pulled up to the Middle School, we<br />
struck white squirrel gold.  Huzzah!  Our search has not been in vain.<br />
Kelly leaps from the car, a little too excitedly &#8212; the squirrel bolts,<br />
and as much as you could imagine kelly &#8220;bolting&#8221;, she does.  The squirrel,<br />
treed, realizes it must escape to warn it&#8217;s white brethren.  We snap a few<br />
sasquatch-esque photos, and move on. </p>
<p>Driving along these little streets, it makes me pine for the days when i<br />
lived in the sticks.  Plenty of open spaces, well manicured lawns.  Old<br />
retirees on the porch, talking of the weather.  Cursing the day when the<br />
white squirrel overlords came to town.  Too old to fight back.  An old man<br />
asks us for safe passage to anywhere but there.  Eyeing our car he wonders<br />
if it&#8217;s fast enough to evade the squirrels.  &#8220;Fast enough for you &#8212; OLD<br />
MAN! She made the escape from Voleville in 1/2 an hour!&#8221; </p>
<p>As we turned onto another street, off in the distance, I noticed a<br />
smattering of white moving on a manicured lawn.  Kelly &#8212; ready your<br />
mount!  Slowly, as if the squirrel doesn&#8217;t notice the huge black car<br />
inching alongside, we roll up to the squirrel.  With cat-like precision<br />
and grace, Kelly stalks the squirrel.  I snap photos from the waiting<br />
getaway car.  The squirrel, posing as if on the front cover of GQ, flashes<br />
a little of the bling-bling servitude we&#8217;ve been clamoring for.  An old<br />
man, reminiscing his days of freedom, eyes Kelly with the scorn of years<br />
of torment.  The squirrel eludes our documentation by slipping through a<br />
fence.  We move on, digital and analog pictures in hand.</p>
<p>We decide to check out the rest of town, which really isn&#8217;t much.  A<br />
little tiny &#8220;downtown&#8221; is about all we get.  Kelly points out that she is<br />
a little disappointed with the squirrel population in Marionville.  I<br />
point out that it isn&#8217;t about the squirrels, never was, never will be.<br />
The trek &#8212; the adventure of it all.  Somehow, i&#8217;d much rather say that<br />
i&#8217;ve been to Marionville than to St. Louis.  Fewer people have experienced<br />
Marionville.  Not to be elitist, but living in a &#8220;city&#8221; for most of my<br />
life has only made me appreciate the small towns all the more.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020429honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/7016-2/04290015_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>We stopped into the post office to mail some postcards.  I love small-town<br />
post offices.  You&#8217;ve got to wonder if the guy behind the counter realizes<br />
that we&#8217;re from out of town.  &#8220;Hey there Miss Linda&#8221;.  &#8220;Later Betty&#8221;.<br />
&#8220;CITY SLICKERS!&#8221;  Hee-hee.  Sitting in front of the post office, i try to<br />
think of it when it was built in 1962.  How things must have changed.  I&#8217;m<br />
sure it was more bustling than it is now.  There is a good little cluster<br />
of buildings down-town, but they have dilapidated to the point of<br />
crumbling.  Old farms along the roads look as if they would fall down if<br />
it weren&#8217;t for the ivy and moss growing on them.  There are a lot of farms<br />
out here, but none look to e all that active, this being spring and all.</p>
<p>We just hit 700 miles on our trip total &#8212; we may make it to OKC this<br />
evening, which would put us ahead of our hastily writtten schedule.</p>
<p>Random sign: Have a Taco, Gringo!</p>
<h2>3:42PM CST</h2>
<p>Miami, OK &#8211; just inside the border, about 3 hours outside of Oklahoma<br />
City.</p>
<p>A flat land, little cover.  In fact, the cows here jostle for space under<br />
or behind shade-bearing objects such as signs and trees.  We whizz past a<br />
sign noting that we are on the &#8220;auto-tour&#8221; of the Trail of Tears.<br />
Somehow, i feel a little odd about that.  Kelly notes: &#8220;We screwed them<br />
over pretty good, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;   Yep.</p>
<h2>11:41 CST</h2>
<p>Whew. Lots of uploading of stuff tonight.  We pulled into Oklahoma City<br />
about 7PM or so, set up camp in a Travelodge and set out to forage for<br />
food.  After going the wrong way, and having to drive about 12 miles for a<br />
mexican restaurant, we found Las Palomas &#8212; a tasty Mexican restaurant.<br />
Good stuff, that.   Looking forward to Amarillo and possibly Albuquerque<br />
tomorrow.  Gonna go see the OKC Murrow Building memorial tomorow, too.</p>

<p>After a restful night, off we go to the Arch, the gateway to western<br />
expansion.  The doorway to the massacre and oppresion of tribal and<br />
indigenous people! we headed downtown from our suburbian enclave<br />
hotel, zipping along i44 up to i70 to the downtown, all of which<br />
took about 20 minutes or so in light traffic.  So far, i&#8217;m loving<br />
this town.  It&#8217;s easy to navigate, and easy to drive. the weather<br />
today was/is beautiful, a little chilly and windy, but the clouds in<br />
the sky are rare.  At first glance, relative to the buildings in<br />
front of the arch, the arch it self doesn&#8217;t seem so impressive.<br />
However, once you get down to it, the sheer beauty and<br />
gravity-defying design of the structure really takes hold. It offers<br />
a number of things when viewed &#8212; motion sickness, if viewed from<br />
directly below, but mostly awe and wonder.  Each direction, each<br />
step to the left or the right seems to bend the arch to the eye.<br />
Often, you can stand in its thin shadow, imagine it as some sort of<br />
kubrickian monolith, the sun peeking out from the side.
</p>
<p>
The park surrounding the arch is sculpted, with two small fowl-laden<br />
lakes on each side.  and while it was indeed beautiful, it almost<br />
seemed a little antiseptic.  It lacked life &#8212; i half expected &#8220;keep<br />
off the grass&#8221; signs.  There were no people flying kites (today was<br />
an excellent kite day), no people playing frisbee, no picknickers.<br />
Oh well, it was pretty.</p>
<p>Underneath the arch is a museum, and the entrance to the tram rides<br />
up to the top (which, at first, kelly feared).  There was a bit of a<br />
wait to pass through the security checkpoint.  Now, i had heard of<br />
extra &#8220;shoe security&#8221; since the Moo-saw-wee thing a while back, and<br />
it was definitely here in full-force.  if you &#8220;beeped&#8221; through the<br />
metal detector, they immediately went to the shoes.  Nevermind the<br />
bomb-hat or the bomb-coat.  Women with flat shoes on were even<br />
asked.  It was a little bizarre.  Note to self: research bomb-hats.  </p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020428honeymoon"><img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/6879-2/04280020_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /></a></p>
<p>We meandered through the museum and the shops there, and i noticed<br />
that the exhibits were pretty Native American friendly, something<br />
that put a smile on my face.  Rather than the exhibits of old were<br />
they were viewed as happy-go-lucky plainspeople embracing the<br />
frontiersman, the disturbing anamatronic chief noted that &#8220;the words<br />
on paper do not mean much&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020428honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/6895-2/04280030_G.jpg" class="FloatRight"  alt=""/></a></p>
<p>The tram ride &#8212; oh, the tram ride.  as if being 630 feet in the air<br />
wasn&#8217;t enough to scare most folks, the tram ride up &#8212; or, actually,<br />
the tram cars were enough to freak you out. They fit five people,<br />
and were completely white on the inside.  And by fitting five, i<br />
mean CRAMMING five.  Heads bent, we squeezed through the<br />
doggie-door-like entrances, and where whisked away, and up.  bumped<br />
heads were often observed, as the curved white surface left little<br />
to the sense of depth-perception.<br />
once atop the arch, it was like being inside a jumbo-jet.  The<br />
constant whir of air conditioning, and the occasional sway of the<br />
arch.  the east-side view was pretty unremarkable, as east st. louis<br />
and cahokia are on the other side of the river.<br />
east st. louis and cahokia are these bizzarre little industrial<br />
towns, but without the industry.  it&#8217;s like bombed-out dresden in a<br />
lot of those cities, and one has to wonder why they are that way.<br />
St. Louis is a pretty good sized city, and the other side of the<br />
river looks like Hannibal&#8217;s elephants ran through it and had salted<br />
the earth.  Many pictures were taken, (see the gallery &#8212; i have<br />
some neat panoramic photos), and in 3 minutes we were back on the<br />
ground.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020428honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/6939-2/04280052_G.jpg" alt="" class="FloatLeft" /></a></p>
<p>Walking to get something to eat, we passed by my main impetus for<br />
coming to St. Louis, the National Coin-Op and Arcade Machine Museum,<br />
which i had visited some 7 years ago.  It was really neat at that<br />
time, with plenty of old games and quarters to be had. now, however,<br />
it is a vacant space open for rent.  surprisingly, as i think it had<br />
shut down about 5 years ago, the sign was still out front, and the<br />
front counter was still installed.  the entire Laclede Landing<br />
(where that is situated) is like that &#8212; a bit depressed, but most<br />
likely with lots of rent :(</p>
<p>We ate in a little food-court thingy, where a chatty chinese woman<br />
wondered if i liked a lot of vegetables in my Chicken w/ garlic<br />
sauce.  I said &#8220;sure, why not&#8221;, and later wished that i had opted<br />
for ALL vegetables and no chicken, as the chicken was less than<br />
good.  the $4.36 total should&#8217;ve tipped me off.</p>
<p><a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/family/honeymoon/20020428honeymoon"><br />
<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/6960-4/04280060_G.jpg" class="FloatRight" alt="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Then we headed back into town to the St. Louis Science Center.<br />
Really quite neat.  Lots of interactive exhibits, which mostly all<br />
worked (yay!) Of course, lots of interesting arch-related ballyhoo,<br />
including a foam &#8220;build your own arch&#8221;, which was way too tall for<br />
small children.  HAHAHA.  Suckers.   Part of the museum went over<br />
the highway.  It was neat.  Also, it was free.  Free==Good.  Yay.</p>
<p>On our way back, kelly wanted to stop at the local shopping malls,<br />
etc.  &#8220;Sure&#8221; i said.  So, we hit a store which i&#8217;ve never seen or<br />
heard of before &#8212; perhaps you have, it&#8217;s called &#8220;target&#8221;.  They<br />
have a whole &#8220;target&#8221; theme.  red and white.  red and white.  Whee.<br />
Oh, kelly says they have Targets in louisville.  Wha?  Oh,<br />
apparently we registered there for our wedding. </p>
<p>Now, onto the real meat of the story &#8212; World Market.  Imagine Pier<br />
One, except &#8220;cooler and cheaper&#8221; (according to kelly), and cheaper<br />
and better.  Why isn&#8217;t there one in Louisville?  I don&#8217;t know, but<br />
all i know is that there should be one.  We got candles and presents<br />
and such.  It was good.  Also, we went to the &#8220;Supermarket of<br />
Shoes&#8221;.  Remember Kelly&#8217;s &#8220;mmaaaaahhhhlll&#8221; mantra of last February&#8217;s<br />
sojourn to Baltimore?  Now, it&#8217;s &#8220;sshoooooo&#8221;.  The Supermarket of<br />
Shoes disappointed, tho, and Kelly was heard to say &#8220;it displeases<br />
me greatly&#8221;.  Ooh well.</p>
<p>For dinner, we tried to track down &#8220;Nachomamma&#8221;, which was a good<br />
name for a tasty restaurant.  Nachomamma! Nachomamma!  Weeeeee!  We<br />
found Nachomamma, but mamma wasn&#8217;t home &#8212; being a sunday, it was<br />
closed.  No abra.  So, instead we went to Steak n&#8217; Shake, and were<br />
greeted with a lovely time.  Then!  Well, we came back here, and are<br />
currently watching Adult Swim (specifically: Sealab 2021 &#8212; which is<br />
kicking my butt at the moment&#8230; hilarious)</p>
<p>tomorrow: Marionville, Illinois, disputed &#8220;mecca of albino<br />
squirrels&#8221;, and on thru to Oklahoma City.  Later, doods!</p>

	    <p>Driving to St. Louis &#8212; originally, we were to stop in Olney, Illinois,<br />
the &#8220;Albino Squirrel&#8221; capital of the world, however<br />
we decided to drive on through to St. Louis to get a room.  The<br />

<p>Rain, rain, rain most of the way.  We made the trip in about 5 hours or so<br />
(which includes checking into the hotel, stopping to eat, etc).  However,<br />
not before we stopped in Collinsville, Illinois, the home of the WORLDS<br />
LARGEST CATSUP bottle.  We got off the exit to Collinsville, and I<br />
remembered that I didn&#8217;t get an address to the catsup bottle, but<br />
considering it was the &#8220;WORLD&#8217;S LARGEST&#8221;, it couldn&#8217;t be that hard to<br />
find. As we rounded a corner, i told Kelly &#8220;keep your eyes peeled for a<br />
GIANT CATSUP BOTTLE!&#8221;, a lo, the heavens parted, and THAR SHE BLOWS! Right<br />
in the middle of &#8220;downtown&#8221; is a big catsup bottle.  Huge, and TANGY!<br />
Pictures were taken.</p>
<p>Navigating St. Louis so far has proven quite easy. At least, easier than<br />
Chicago, which was my first real &#8220;big city&#8221; driving experience.  Chicago<br />
is like some sort of horrible boot camp for driving. They might as well<br />
have been firing live rounds over the highway, because the road itself<br />
seemed to have bomb craters in it.  If only the toll-booth operators<br />
would have spit tobacco juice on your shoe and said &#8220;Looks like you need a<br />
shine, son!&#8221;, but i digress.</p>

<p>We managed to make our way up to University City, to get a little dinner,<br />
and just browse the &#8220;cool&#8221; section of town.  At first, that &#8220;cool&#8221;<br />
designation was called into question.  Allow me to pontificate.</p>
<p>The main drag in University City is Delmar Street.  We hit the main<br />
section of University City, and saw this really neat looking building, and<br />
I said &#8220;ooooh&#8221; and kelly said &#8220;aahhh&#8221;.  And then we both went &#8220;ooooh&#8221; like<br />
we just saw someone fall off a bike. Turns out, that &#8220;really cool&#8221;<br />
building was a huge Church of Scientology!  It was massive and<br />
office-looking.  In fact, the sign out front looked like the entrance to a<br />
mini-mall, or at least an office park.  Note to self: if your church looks<br />
like there should be cubicles in it, or they are playing Muzak in hallways<br />
&#8211; GET OUT.  That goes for you, John Travolta.</p>
<p>Now, the &#8220;cool&#8221; was restored by the VERY NEXT BUILDING.  The University<br />
City City Hall was awesome.  It was just a big, round cylinder.  Weee!  A<br />
neo Hall of Justice.</p>

<img src="https://thelocust.org/gallery/d/6788-2/04270009_G.jpg" class="FloatRight" /></a></p>
<p>Kelly wanted to checked out &#8220;Iron Age&#8221;, a piercing/tatoo shop.  It was<br />
quite awesome, the entire seciton of town was<br />
quite neat.  It was a little like downtown Charleston, tho&#8217;, I must admit<br />
that Bardstown Rd. has it beat.  Aaaanyway.  Kelly got her nose pierced<br />
again, and it took about 10 minutes in-the-door/out-the-door.  Later, we<br />
found the &#8220;Thai Country Cafe&#8221; &#8211; a little Thai restaurant.  Wow.  Finally,<br />
an honest to goodness Thairestaurant.  Kelly had the vegetarian pad-thai,<br />
and the vegetarian spring rolls, and i had the Chicken Satay and the Yum<br />
Gai (Thai Chicken Salad).  Washed down with a Singha beer (Thai Budweiser,<br />
i think). A cool little restaurant all done up like a Thai tea house or<br />
somesuch.</p>
<p>After dinner (which was tasty and cheap), we walked on down the road<br />
aways, and in only about a block, the hip part of town turned into the<br />
&#8220;get accosted by homeless folks&#8221; area, and it lived up to its name. I<br />
don&#8217;t remember the guys name, but he showed me his ID, and i guessed his<br />
age at 50 (i was right on).  His mother had apparently just died, yada<br />
yada.  I don&#8217;t mean to sound shallow, but when someone comes up to me with<br />
a pre-planned speech, replete with props, it&#8217;s a little hard to believe.<br />
I feel for the guy, but damn.  I gave him $.50, and he was on his way.  I<br />
really hate that shit.  Not that I hate homeless people, but I hate having<br />
to brush people off like that.  I&#8217;m sure he has seen some hard times, but<br />
I&#8217;m not the one to pull him out of the gutter, and how is my dollar going<br />
to do that?  Yar.  </p>
<p>Anyway, later on the ride home, we jammed to the new Wilco (&#8220;Yankee Hotel<br />
Foxtrot&#8221;), and it rained and rained, so hard, in fact that the road looked<br />
like it had waves in it.  Sheet after sheet of rain.  And despite all<br />
that, it was ten times easier driving than on a sunny day in Chicago.  So<br />
far, so good.</p>
<p>Alrighty, off to see the sites &#8217;round town &#8212; the National Coin-op and<br />
Video Game Museum (does it still exist?!), the arch, the Anheuser Busch<br />
Tour, the Kids Museum, etc.  Tomorrow &#8212; checkout and on the way to<br />
Oklahoma City (and Marionville, Illinois).</p>

	    <p>Go, and read an article about <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/21/gen.airlines.arabs.removed/>men of Arab descent being removed from flights</a>, and try not to become enraged.</p>
<p>
And why were they removed?  Because, and I quote, &#8220;the crew didn&#8217;t feel <i>comfortable</i>&#8220;, or &#8220;didn&#8217;t feel safe&#8221;.  One man, Ashraf Khan, a Pakistani, was removed from a flight in Texas &#8212; and missed flights to take him to his brothers wedding. None of the people removed &#8212; including a 15 year old Saudi boy &#8212; were perceived as a &#8220;threat&#8221;, and were later cleared.</p>
<p>
Everyone right now feels uncomfortable, unsafe, and the people who feel the most uncomfortable?  Americans of Arab descent.</p>

    </div><!--/head-->
	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>So, I&#8217;m reading this article over at <a href=http://www.cnn.com>CNN</a>, entitled &#8220;<a href=http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/06/07/bush.taxes/>$1.35 trillion dollar tax cut signed into law</a>&#8220;.  It mentions the rebate program, which will start July 20th &#8212; <i>&#8220;Singles will get $300, single parents will receive $500 and married couples will see a $600 rebate.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>
Now, any American who has taken Economics, or at least blown their entire paycheck and/or Christmas bonus in one booze-fueled fandango near the end of the month KNOWS that the &#8220;<a href=http://ecolan.sbs.ohio-state.edu/Aly/classes/powerpoint/ch9/tsld012.htm>marginal propensity to save</a>&#8221; in the United States is SHOCKINGLY low.  Somewhere around 5%, as compared to somewhere around 25% in Japan (as best I can remember).  Way to go Bush!<br />
{more}</p>
<p>
Let me explain here.  How did most of the richest folks in the United States become rich?  Hitting the lottery?  No.  The way you &#8220;make money&#8221; isn&#8217;t necessarily important.  I could make fat sacks of <i>cash money</i>, but those <i>fat sacks</i> wouldn&#8217;t do me a damned bit of good if I kept spending it all.  Which brings me to the point &#8212; rich people SAVE money.  Thats why they are RICH.  If they didn&#8217;t SAVE money, then they would be POOR.  Bush&#8217;s primary impetus behind the $300 rebates was to &#8220;stimulate the economy&#8221;.  To the richer portion of those rebatees, they will merely toss that $300 on their already fat pile of money, meanwhile, the <i>POOR SAPS</i> like you and I will most likely either use it in the <a href=http://www.fortunecity.de/kraftwerk/goldi/326/Sounds/Songtext/Other/Puffin.html>aforementioned fashion</a>, or pay down our debts.  It will most likely not go towards the &#8220;general economy&#8221;, and that is my primary concern.  So, giving $300 to every single taxpayer (who filed this year) is going to do a fat lot of fucking good, if you ask me!</p>
<p>
In fact, I&#8217;m probably either going to:<br />
<br />
A) Donate it to a good cause, which may or may not be the &#8220;Get Ben Drunk on Expensive Imported Irish Tasty Beer&#8217;<br />
<br />
B) Soil it, and return it to the White House<br />
C) Pay down my debt.<br />
D) Go completely against everything I stated above and buy a new TV, VCR, or a small immigrant house-boy, who will live in the closet.</p>
<p>
All of this rebate nonsense just seems like very short-sighted policy on behalf of the Bush administration.  Which apparently is a theme in the Oval Office.  We&#8217;ll infuse the American public with $300 rebates, which will provide <i>minutes</i> of fun to the populous, which will pay for about 1 tank-full of gas for our SUVs, which by the way are the reason why we need MORE OIL.  To hell with this conservation (read: SAVING).  But that, my friends, is a whole other story.</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
	    <p>All Hail Kang!  New Ruler of The United States of Kang! <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> is reporting that Al Gore is to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/13/president.election/index.html">address the nation</a> tonight at 9 PM (supposedly to concede, though they didn&#8217;t postulate on that one), and that he has informed his recount committee to suspend operations, and pack it in.</p>
<p>
Well, as much as I wanted to see Gore win this thing, I&#8217;m glad he is bowing out now.  Many democratic pundits have stated that they want nothing more than for Gore to go out guns blazing, but that is truly silly.  Give Bush a shot for four years.  If he mucks things up, rest assured the Dem&#8217;s will control the senate and house in 2 years.</p>
<p>
Me, personally?  I&#8217;m glad.  I haven&#8217;t had anything to bitch about in 8 years.</p>
<p>
Oh, and don&#8217;t blame me, <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/~jmaxson/patch/bios/kang2.html">I voted for Kodos</a>!</p>

<p>
Though, <a href="http://foxnews.com/election_night/after/trail_111000.sml">according to Fox News</a>, this could all drag on with the legal battles and the justice and what-not.  While I feel that the Democrats should concede, I think that the lawsuits and legal actions being taken in Florida are a good thing(TM).</p>

UPDATE [Not too long after this had been posted! Actually, even WHILE this article was posted] &#8212; Ok, i&#8217;m wrong.  It&#8217;s not true.  I don&#8217;t know why I posted this, really.  It&#8217;s only the county recount that is done.  Absentee ballots, legal wrangling, and all else still needs to be done.  I tell ya, the news media these days is (as Dan Rather would put it) &#8220;as useless as tits on a bull!&#8221;</p>
