<p><a href="http://www.ae4rv.com" class="External">Geoff</a>, <a href="http://dionysia.org/" class="External">Dan</a> and I went to eat lunch over <a href="http://acme.com/mapper/?lat=38.238358&#038;long=-85.55423&#038;scale=10&#038;theme=Image&#038;width=3&#038;height=2&#038;dot=Yes" class="External">in the park by Crosby Middle School</a> today.</p>
<p>I had just finished my tasty cheese sandwich and my <a href="http://www.sodapopstop.com/products/detail.cfm?link=67" class="External">Dr.  Brown&#8217;s Cel-Ray Soda</a> when I peeked over to my left shoulder to notice something like a dried leaf.  Upon further inspection, I notice it&#8217;s some HUGE BUG.  Naturally, I retain my calm and gently brush the thing off my shoulder.   At least, that&#8217;s what happened in the version of the story that doesn&#8217;t make me seem like a big weenie.  I batted at my shoulder and stood up, screaming like a little girl.  Summing the courage to turn my head in the general direction of my shoulder again &#8212; I did, slowly.  IT WAS STILL THERE!!! AHHHH!!! Finally, I dislodged the damned thing and it flew onto our picnic table, where it sat for a little while, but then finally took wing, in a slow, lumbering manner.</p>
<p>I took note of it&#8217;s odd spiny protuberance on its back, it&#8217;s nearly 1.5&#8243; length, and its &#8220;headless mantis&#8221; sort of look, and went back to work determined to identify this thing.  My initial searches for &#8220;insect identification&#8221; and &#8220;insect database&#8221; were inconclusive.  Finally, I decided to check for &#8220;Kentucky insects&#8221;, and found a site at the <a href="http://www.uky.edu" class="External">University of Kentucky</a> Department of Entymology called &#8220;<a href="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/CritterFiles/casefile/casefile.htm" class="External">The Critter Case Files</a>&#8221; (an excellent resource for Kentucky insects).  Having never seen anything of it&#8217;s sort in Kentucky before, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I&#8217;d find it.  However, after a short search I determined that this was in fact an &#8220;<a href="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/CritterFiles/casefile/insects/bugs/assassin/assassin.htm" class="External">Assassin Bug</a>&#8220;.  A &#8220;<a href="http://www.hiltonpond.org/ThisWeek030901.html" class="External">wheel bug</a>&#8220;, to be exact.  My estimation of 1.5&#8243; was right on target &#8212; and it&#8217;s slow flight characteristics seemed to be right on (though the clincher was that spiny ridge on its back).</p>
<p>Despite my harrowing encounter, and subsequent taunting, I&#8217;m glad that I had my near assassination attempt.</p>

Specifically, the lemon variety.  <a href="http://www.louisvillehotbytes.com/thaismile.shtml"  class="External">Thai Smile 4</a> has a large bowl of them.  I took a lemon, as is my want.  I got back to work, and realized I had yet to eat it.  Now, I&#8217;m not one to just chew it up and swallow it.  The lemon variety of Jolly Rancher lasts for quite a while &#8212; and I intend on enjoying every bit of it.  Well, that is, I <i>intended</i> on enjoying it, until a twist of my tongue shot it into my throat at an unretrievable velocity.  As the lemony goodness was fast disappearing, I briefly considered attempting to regurgitate it.  However, imagining both agreeable and unagreeable outcomes of such a solution, I decided against it.</p>
<p>Oh well.  Unexpected swallowing is something I wish wouldn&#8217;t happen. </p>

	    <p>
tuesday hunter and I were left to our own devices as nick was working and joey was doing errands of some sort.  so, off to the <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/" class="External">Art Institute of Chicago</a> (you know, the one from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0091042"  class="External">Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off</a>).  again, we managed to utlize public transportation in a fashion becoming a pair of adults, and the &#8220;L&#8221; dropped us off a block from the art museum.  now, despite the fact that I studied (and lived for a short time) near the <a href="http://www.speedmuseum.org"  class="External">J. B. Speed Art Museum</a>, I never actually went it.  Oh, and my mother was an art teacher for a while, but that didn&#8217;t get me in to an art museum either.  so yeah, it was fairly overwhelming.  you can look at photographic reproductions of art in books all you want, but that just does not do these paintings justice in the least.  Degas mastery of light and shadow are breathtaking to see.  Picasso&#8217;s &#8220;The Old Guitarist&#8221; when reproduced on the page is a bland shadow of the true color of the work.  I am a big fan of Magritte&#8217;s work and they had plenty of his works there, as a number of other surrealists and modern artists.  I could go on for days, but I think I&#8217;ll keep this short: you need to go.  On Tuesdays, &#8217;cause then it&#8217;s free.  But even on normal days, it&#8217;s only $10 and that is a suggested donation.  I should point out that non-flash photography is allowed in the Institute, but my forgetful self forget to bring the memory card for my camera.</p>
<p>After 3 hours in the Art Institute, we decided to nab a bite to eat at <a href="http://www.potbelly.com/"  class="External">Potbelly Sandwich Works</a>, so we hopped the train back a couple of stops.  Potbelly&#8217;s is like a Quizno but with the old-timey flair of Another Place Sandwich Shop in Louisville. The sandwiches were tasty.  The root beer cold.  Yum.</p>
<p>Now, our next stop requires a little explaining.  Hunter had bought issue #2 of <a href="http://www.foundmagazine.com" class="External">Found Magazine</a> (a magazine filled with &#8220;found&#8221; notes , pictures, letters, etc) along with a couple other &#8216;zines (hipper, cooler magazines than your mama&#8217;s) while at <a href="http://www.chicagocomics.com/"  class="External">Chicago Comics</a>, and was interested in finding more.  Knowing this, I happened to see an ad for a &#8216;zine distro down on Augusta Boulevard near downtown.  Thinking &#8220;hey, this would be a cool little side trip&#8221;, we decided that would be our next stop.  Having had procured directions from the venerable and always trustworthy <a href="http://www.mapquest.com"  class="External">MapQuest</a> and peeping a <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/"  class="External">CTA</a> map we felt confident.  Well, I figured that the CTA&#8217;s Green Line trains were the closest alternative, so we got off at the Ashland stop. Well, some many many blocks later we arrive at <a href="http://www.loopdistro.com"  class="External">Loop Distro</a> at 1357 W. Augusta #1.  It is apparent that this is, in fact, someones apartment.  Thinking that &#8220;this is the &#8216;zine way of life man!&#8221;, we checked around.  No other doors say #1, and the one that is #1 has photos inexplicably taped all over it.  Check the knob &#8212; locked.  Hmm.  Well.  Checking the website, it would seem that this joint is really just a distribution point.  The ad wasn&#8217;t so clear.  Ah well.  We had an exciting time rolling through &#8220;Little Mexico City&#8221; anyway.</p>
<p>Turns out the Division Street stop on the Blue Line was far, far, closer to Loop Distro, so we ended up taking that home.  I took a nap, because I&#8217;m old and walking is tiring.</p>
<p>Hunter contacted his friend Patience and his cousin Jeremy and Nick checked out the deal on the <a href="http://www.secondcity.com"  class="External">Second City</a> show (<a href="http://www.secondcity.com/theatre/chicago/etc/index.asp"  class="External">Second City Unhinged</a>) we were planning on seeing that night.  Plans were set.  Off to the Second City Etc. theatre.  Jeremy was leaning against the building, as is his want, and we headed upstairs to find Patience, uh, patiently waiting.  Patience is very charming, and appears younger than her age (which I won&#8217;t mention, well, yeah, i mean, it&#8217;s not everyday you meet a 600 year old woman that looks 29).  Also, Patience complimented this <a href="../../../../index.html"  >very site</a>, so she&#8217;s A Number-1 Top Dollar in my book.  She is also a fan of Magritte, so yeah, Patience, you mah dogg.  (BTW, Patience works for the <a href="http://www.capecod.mass.edu/"  class="External">Cape Cod Community College</a> bookstore, owned by <a href="http://www.efollett.com"  class="External">Follett</a>, and is in town for a conference of some sort.  Limos were provided.) Anyway.  As mentioned, Jeremy was there and Hunter and I related that I had called him a &#8220;political mercenary&#8221; in a <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/411">previous post</a>.  He said that consultancy is really more like whoring, and I rebutted that whores are just &#8220;sexual mercenaries&#8221;.  Jeremy is cool, but he needs to accept his role in life as a kick-ass take-no-prisoners political mercenary.  Soldier of Fortune sorta stuff.  Yeah.  Heh.  Seriously folks, Jeremy is way cool. WAAAY COOL.  Rad, even.   Okay, now that I&#8217;ve finished lathering platitudes on these folks I just met, I&#8217;ll get on with the travelogue.</p>
<p>This Second City show involved 3 different improv groups all doing fairly different shows and mixing up styles and whatnots.  Adding to the spectacular comedy was incidental piano music on the side of the stage, and coordinated lighting, which made things all the more fluid and interesting.  The improv was great and very fluid.  I think that the true key of improv is knowing what your fellow actors are going to do without having to say a word.  When that happens, it really clicks.  The first group, &#8220;Tuesday Night Special&#8221; did a rambling long-form (a la Project Improv), the second group &#8220;The Dirty Half Dozen&#8221; did about a half-dozen sketches each based on a single suggestion.  My suggestion for &#8220;something you find in the kitchen&#8221; was &#8220;my wife&#8221;, which I think stunned the performer who was asking for the suggestion, but the sketch turned out funny as hell.  The real ha-ha is that neither Kelly or I spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  So, the groups interpretation of this animal-like &#8220;wife&#8221; character that has to be flushed out of the kitchen by fire was all the more funny to me.  And the girl playing &#8220;the wife&#8221; was hot and funny and had glasses.  Real tall, though.  The last group &#8220;Train Wreck&#8221; was just two guys, one playing the part of a lifeguard, the other as a towel rental clerk.  Metaphysical pondering about alter-egos across the sea have never been funnier.  Also, killing dead air with the line &#8220;So&#8230; You remember when you killed that guy?&#8221; always has a good outcome.</p>
<p>We hit an Irish pub sorta thing after the show, but they weren&#8217;t serving food, so we downed a round and found a Subway.  Jeremy split, as a good mercenary needs his beauty sleep, and we ate our sandwiches while listening to overnight AM sports shows.  We had passed a cool little dive called the <a href="http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Bars-OldTownAleHouseFromNewOnTheScene!PlaceDetail-2275,00.html"  class="External">Old Town Ale House</a>.  A jazz-laden jukebox kept time while we sat in the front window conversing over pints.  A good time was had by all.  We decided to split up, and Patience took a cab back to her hotel, which was probably going to be expensive, so Nick and Hunter chipped in (hey, I bought the drinks).</p>
<p>So &#8212; what&#8217;s ahead for today?  Well, Hunter and I will be driving back to Louisville leaving here sometime mid-afternoonish (to beat the Chicago rush hour, and hopefully the Indianapolis rush hour as well). </p>

<p>sunday! sunday! sunday!</p>
<p>So yeah, went to see <a href="http://www.thematrix.com"  class="External">The Matrix: Reloaded</a> at a theatre up in Evanston.  &#8216;Twas huge, it was!  They do their concessions great up there, too &#8212; cafeteria style.  The second time around, I tried harded to listen to a lot of the dialogue that flew past me during my first screening (i.e. the Merovingian&#8217;s speech and the Architect&#8217;s speech).  Well, I still love it &#8212; not necessarily as a film standing on it&#8217;s own, because it does have it&#8217;s flaws, but as a very interesting continuation and expansion of the world of the Matrix.  I won&#8217;t go into gory detail here in case you, gentle reader, have not seen this, but Nick, Hunter and Joey had some very interesting conversations about it.  While there isn&#8217;t a clear &#8220;a-ha!&#8221; moment in this film like the first Matrix, the events and revelations in this film open up a LOT of new questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, The Matrix: Reloaded aside, after the movie we headed up to <a href="http://www.wildoats.com"  class="External">Wild Oats</a> to get provisions.  Hunter and I were going to cook Nick and Joey dinner as a bit of repayment for their hospitality.  <i>In your face, Project Improv!</i> (they stayed with Joey and Nick a couple of weeks ago).  Anyway, Hunter and I fashioned a tasty dinner of spaghetti and salad and tasty bread.  Would you like to see it? Sure you would. Check the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20030525chicago"  class="External">Chicago: Day Two Gallery</a> (note well Joey&#8217;s perfect pancake).  That Hunter sets a fine table.  Wine was had.  Corks were broken.  Broken corks summarily extracted.  Fine china was used.  Hunter is &#8220;now a believer&#8221; of the tastiness of balsamic vinagrette.  I consider it a culinary victory.  In true man-fanshion, Hunter and I both fell asleep after dinner while Joey and Nick washed the dishes.  I felt like my grandfather.</p>
<p>So today, Memorial Day, we headed out to the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field to see the <a href="http://www.chicagocubs.com"  class="External">Chicago Cubs</a> take on the <a href="http://www.pittsburghpirates.com"  class="External">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>.  It was a drubbing unlike any other I have ever seen.  The Cubs were whipped 10-0 with a Pittsburgh 9-run eigth inning.  We did, however, see Kerry Wood pitch effectively, but with the couple of walks and wild pitches (one of which allowed them to score a run) he certainly could have had a better outing.  The eigth inning was atrocious.  Cubs fans are known as a fickle bunch, but I could have sworn they were about to riot as the 7th run passed the plate.  Many of those runs scored on walks, so that always riles the fans.  Ahh well.  Alfonseca had a 3-0 count on some guy, and he finally pitched a strike &#8212; and the fans went wild!  Hah.  Oh well.</p>
<p>The whole Wrigleyville area is pretty cool.  Drummers and odd street performers abound.  However, as evidenced by <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20030526chicago/20030526_chicago_day3_21_killthedrummers">this picture</a>, not all of the Wrigleyville regulars are appreciative.  Check out the rest of the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20030526chicago">Chicago: Day Three Gallery</a> if&#8217;n you wanna.</p>
<p>There are some loose plans to go and see Lake Michigan which is only 2 blocks away (you can see it from the street).  Oddly enough, Joey and Nick have not gone down to see it.  Well, we can&#8217;t have that, now can we?  Probably going to meet up with a friend of Hunter&#8217;s named &#8220;Patience&#8221;, and perchance to see a Second City show.  Oh, and Hunter and I are on our own tomorrow, so we&#8217;ll probably be heading out to the Chicago Art Museum, which is free and great.  And while free things are always great, free art is even greater.  Yeah.  More later!</p>
<p>
<i>update</i>: added more photos of us down by Lake Michigan to the <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/20030526chicago">Day 3 Gallery</a>. (a good pan of Hunter on the beach awaits you!)</p>

<p>
Kelly and I went to the fair today.  Many people I know have an aversion to the fair, but frankly, I love it.  Not for the expensive beer and the crap-filled Midway, but for the animals, art, and the various and sundry people you see there&#8230;  There are quite a few shots of some of the excellent art found there &#8212; photographic and otherwise.  You should check it out&#8230;  Enjoy!</p>
