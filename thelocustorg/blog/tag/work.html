A brief, if very enlightening article (from way back in 2004) on Harvard Professor John Stilgoe, who teaches a class in &#8220;exploration&#8221; (as stated in the article).  It strikes me as less exploration and more of understanding the messages that are broadcast to us by things we encounter everyday &#8211; the critical understanding of form, function, and in a large part, advertising.</p>
<p>
Read here: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/31/60minutes/main590907.shtml" class="External">The Eyes Have It (Professor Teaches A New Way Of Looking At Things)</a></p>
<p>
Having been in the employ of an advertising agency for the past four years, I&#8217;ve come to understand that all advertising has been designed for some effect.  The shape of a Coke bottle, the hidden arrow in a FedEx logo, the smell of fries from McDonalds.  They&#8217;ve all been designed &#8211; for you.  Understanding this can radically change your perspective on the world.</p>

<p class="Caption">Team Holey Calamity represent!</p>
<p>
Back at the end of August, <a href="http://www.powercreative.com" class="External">Power Creative</a> hosted it&#8217;s first-annual <a href="http://www.playcornhole.org/" class="External">Cornhole</a> tournament to benefit <a href="http://www.lightthenight.org/" class="External">the Light the Night Walk for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>.  We raised some $2000+ dollars for the cause &#8211; thanks to the 40+ two-man teams that signed up.  A bracket-style tournament thus ensued with 13 different cornhole sets set up on Power&#8217;s campus.  Fried chicken and sweet tea was served and we had a good old time.
</p>
<h2>Wait a minute&#8230; CORNHOLE?!</h2>
<p>
For those of you who don&#8217;t know what this is&#8230; it&#8217;s essentially horseshoes with beanbags (filled with corn).  You throw at a hole in a 2&#8242; wide, 4&#8242; long board with a hole in it, 27&#8242; away.  Three points in the hole, one point on the board.  It&#8217;s a tailgating/NASCAR thing.  I had long eschewed it, but it&#8217;s a simple game to learn, hard to master.  Like bocce!

<p>
I partnered up with Charlie &#8220;Chadillionaire&#8221; Dillon and thus was formed team &#8220;Holey Calamity&#8221; (from Handsome Boy Modeling Schools&#8217; <em>So&#8230; How&#8217;s your girl?</em> album).  I even fashioned my own cornhole set (<a href="http://home.fuse.net/mikebrungs/cornhole.htm" class="External">from these printable cornhole plans</a>!) with our team logo (see shirts above).  We&#8217;d only played cornhole once or twice before, but we managed to take 2nd in the tournament!  It was great fun and I&#8217;m looking forward to it again next year for sure.

I don&#8217;t know what all that&#8217;s about, but yeah dang I been busy as of late.  I&#8217;ve got to set down this load in digi-print, so here goes &#8211;  I&#8217;ve got all sorts of stuff going down in town:
</p>
<p>
I helped to develop and launch a thing for GE called <a href="http://www.sharekitchenconfessions.com" class="External">Confessions from the Kitchen</a> with my Flash guy <a href="http://www.ae4rv.com">Geoff</a>.  Real interesting project, that (in the &#8220;saying&#8221; sense of the word).
</p>
<p>
Also, I trained for and ran the <a href="http://www.derbyfestivalmarathon.com/" class="External">Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon</a> (13.1 miles).  I had this crazy idea that I could do it in 2 hours, and by some aligning of fates, I did it.  2 hours, 35 seconds.  I never, ever could have done it without the determination and love of my lady KELLY.  I owe her a lot for getting me to that point.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve also been a model-building <em>fool</em> this winter.  I built an Apogee handlaunch plane (my first-ever bagged wing), finished my <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/wind-dancer/" class="External">Wind Dancer electric sailplane</a>, built and flew a <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/redwing/" class="External">Redwing electric wing</a>, built an <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/products/xp-5/" class="External">XP-5 discus-launched glider</a>, and am currently finishing up a prototype discus-launched glider for <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Denny @ Polecat</a>.
</p>
<p>
Delving deeper into my R/C soaring passion, I&#8217;ve been tapped to write the <a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/events/natsnews.asp" class="External">NATS News</a> coverage for the soaring events at the 2007 AMA/LSF Nationals!  I&#8217;d apparently impressed a few people when I did <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/747">my coverage of the World Soaring Masters</a> back in September.  I&#8217;ll be writing daily articles and shooting photos.  Really excited about that!
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I&#8217;ve signed up to tow F3J at the NATS this year!  F3J is a class of soaring event that is internationally recognized, and there are &#8220;World Championships&#8221; held every two years.  While most of soaring is an individual affair, F3J a team effort requiring a manager, pilots, callers (people who tell the pilots what is going on) and towmen, who actually pull the plane up into the sky.  The 2007 League of Silent Flight / AMA Nationals in Muncie (aka &#8220;the NATS&#8221;) is hosting an F3J competition this year, and I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of it.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll also be travelling in June to the <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/polecat-challenge-2007/" class="External">2007 Polecat Challenge</a>, one of the best handlaunch soaring competitions in the country!  And currently, I&#8217;m trying to aid Bruce Davidson in his attempt to claim <a href="http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=666241" class="External">the highest handlaunch in the world</a>!
</p>
<p>
Continuing the aviation theme, my brother (who recently served OJ Simpson twice in one week at his restaurant, because <a href="http://www.whas11.com/topstories/stories/050907whasrtTopOJTossed.5014ed1b.html" class="External">some people just don&#8217;t care for OJ</a>) and I took my dad up to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum up in Dayton, Ohio for his sixtieth birthday (May 6th)!  I love that place, and we all had a good time&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Did I mention I&#8217;m coaching the softball team at Power Creative?  How nuts is that?!  Our first practice is TONIGHT.
</p>
<p>
I <em>need</em> to get things done!</p>

The title says it all.  While I normally keep work-life out of the blog-life, I&#8217;ll make an exception now, on account of the many, many lurkers that frequent this site, many of whom are either former co-workers of mine, or are of the nerdly persuasion.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.powercreative.com" class="External">Power Creative</a> needs web developers, and in a good way.  We&#8217;ve got plenty of work and we need people (like me) who can walk, talk, chew gum and code in a number of languages.  Communication, problem-solving and learning skills might even be more important, and I&#8217;ll tell you why: Power Creative is an advertising agency, and the &#8220;Interactive&#8221; (it&#8217;s ad agency speak) department where you&#8217;d work is not like the dinosaur-pen or cube-farm to which you might be familiar.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not for everyone, it&#8217;s true.  You&#8217;ll be doing some serious warrior-poet sorta stuff here &#8211; a little analysis, a little design, and a good bit of development.  You won&#8217;t just be &#8220;the developer&#8221;, but rather someone who works as part of a larger team inside the agency.  You want project ownership?  You&#8217;ll have it.  Power&#8217;s &#8220;Interactive&#8221; department is small, but growing and more often than not you&#8217;ll be the point-wo(man) on the job at hand.
</p>
<p>
What is for everyone, however, is the stability of the job, the varied experience and the culture of the place.  Power (which has been around since the late 1960&#8242;s) is a ridiculously diversified compared to the strictly Interactive agencies.  We&#8217;ve got photo studios, copywriters, creative designers, set builders, ad buyers, media planners, etc, etc.   We service any number of high-profile clients, like GE and Lennox to hometown favorites like Hillerich &#038; Bradsby and Louisville Stoneware.  We develop in many languages on many environments (PHP, ASP/VBscript, .NET, Windows, *nix, Mac), and you&#8217;ll be sure to expand your skill set.  Finally, the culture of the place is excellent.  I can&#8217;t imagine anywhere else I&#8217;d rather work.

Oh man, it&#8217;s that time again!  Fall isn&#8217;t here yet, but it&#8217;s right around the corner and you know what fall is &#8211; <i>CHILI SEASON</i>.  And let me tell you, it&#8217;s ON this year with a capital &#8220;O&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Last year, I helped to organize a Chili Battle at <a href="http://www.powercreative.com" target="_blank">work</a> and we raised some $500 for <a href="http://www.leukemia.org" class="External">the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a> and <a href="http://www.lightthenight.org/" class="External">the Light the Night Walk</a>.  We had a dozen chilis and 60 eaters compete and we had a ball doing so.  I ended up taking 3rd place and Interactive Department colleague Shareen took 2nd.  We were both bested by a GE Team-entered white chili!  We vowed then to take back the coveted chili trophy!
</p>
<p>This year, we have expanded the competition to include 4 categories: Traditional (meat and tomato-based), White (not tomato), Hot and Other (veggie, ethnic, etc).  There will still be a Grand Prize winner, which we have termed &#8220;the Best of Bowl&#8221;.  Today at lunch, I made <a href="../../content/files/powerchilicookoff2006.pdf">flyer for the 2006 Chili Battle</a> &#8211; and I really like it. </p>
<p>
As far as my chili this year goes, I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to cook.  I&#8217;ve flirted with a Thai-style chili as well as a Greek-style chili, but I&#8217;m thinking of sticking closer to last year with another dark chicken chili.  But this year, after much soul-searching and demographic investigation, I think I have just the thing to sway the Power people into my camp!</p>

Man, have I been busy as of late!  Let me roll it down to you <i>blog</i> style!
</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/ezbd-docs-DRAFT-cover.jpg" class="FloatRight" /></p>
<p>
First up, since about January, I&#8217;ve been helping out my buddy Denny over at <a href="http://www.polecataero.com">Polecat Aeroplane Works</a> to build the prototype of his new sailplane, the <a href="http://polecatareo.com/products/ezbd" class="External">EZ Bubble Dancer</a>.  You may remember that I <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/662">built something similar last winter</a>, called the <a href="../../soaring/allegrolite.html">Allegro-Lite</a>.  The EZ Bubble Dancer is the &#8220;big brother&#8221; to what I built, with a 117&#8243; wingspan.  Denny saw my <a href="https://thelocust.org/gallery/v/soaring/allegro/">Allegro-Lite Building Gallery</a> and offered to let me build the first EZ Bubble Dancer.  I was elated!  It took me a little longer than I had expected, but it was the first kit to be built, so I guess that is expected.  I also volunteered to write the instruction manual, which ended up as a <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/uploads/ezbd/ezbd-docs-DRAFT.pdf" class="External">59-page tome with full color photos</a>.  A lot of work, but well worth it!  Oh, and I also help maintain the <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Polecat Aero website</a> and have been helping out with Denny&#8217;s <a href="http://www.polecataero.com/polecat-challenge-2006" class="External">ginormous handlaunch  contest</a> as well.
</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/midsouth2006flyer.jpg" class="FloatLeft" /></p>
<p>
Even deeper into hobby news, I&#8217;ve been helping to organize and plan the <a href="http://louisvillesoaring.org/content/view/105/43/" class="External">2006 MidSouth Soaring Championships</a> which will be held here in Louisville in late June/early July.  I wrote the <a href="http://louisvillesoaring.org/media/midsouth2006flyer.pdf" class="External">flyer</a> for the contest, and am pretty close to finalizing a t-shirt design.
</p>
<p>
At work we&#8217;ve been pretty busy!  The Interactive Department where I work has seen some changes over the past few months &#8211; and for the good!  Last fall we added <a href="http://x13design.com/bipolar/" class="External">Matt Rasnake</a>, a friend of mine and a fellow ex-Corvus Digital Systems employee.  In the interim between the fall of Corvus and Power, he worked for GE on web stuff. He&#8217;s done right well at Power, and we&#8217;ve certainly had enough to keep him busy.  This spring, we added <a href="http://www.lostinlouisville.com" class="External">Jackson Cooper</a>, another friend of mine and chum from my <a href="http://cbpa.louisville.edu/AcademicPrograms/CIS.htm" class="External">University of Louisville College of Business / Computer Information System</a> days who actually interviewed at Corvus a few times.  He&#8217;s had better luck here at Power and like Matt, is doing very well and staying busy.
</p>
<p>
Me?  Well, apparently last summer I was promoted, and didn&#8217;t know it!  Now, I&#8217;m heading up a team of folks in the Interactive Department and moving into more of a Analyst role while still &#8220;keeping my hands dirty&#8221; in development of websites and such.  I also got to pick my title, which I finally decided was &#8220;Senior Interactive Analyst / Developer&#8221;.  We had a bit of a &#8220;Programmer&#8221; vs. &#8220;Developer&#8221; debate up here, and I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of title &#8220;Programmer&#8221;.  That insinuates that all I do is write line after line of code all day long, which I&#8217;ll tell you is so remote from the truth that it boggles the mind. (Insert your witty puns here, friends).
</p>
<p>
On the fun and fitness end of things, I ran two miles <i>in a row</i> last night and did not collapse.  It actually felt pretty good!  Now, I probably won&#8217;t be trail-running or doing miniMarathons with Kelly any time soon, but it was nice to know that I could run from thugs or bears for a while and at least give them a decent go for it.
</p>
<p>
Finally, on the games front, I&#8217;ve been playing in a poker tournament hosted by colleague and <i>interactive marketing consultant</i> <a href="http://jaylane.com/" class="External">Jay Lane</a> for the past 6 months, one night a month.  I&#8217;ve been fair-to-middling placing as high as 4th out of the 21 people that play each month.  Chuck Pearsall, Hunter Dixon and Chris Gerstle have faired much better (in that order) with Chris being in first place at the moment!  The final tourney is this weekend.  While I don&#8217;t think I have a chance at the money, I hope to ruin someone&#8217;s day!
</p>
<p>
Softball season is also upon us!  Power Softball is in a rebuilding year after a fun year of 1-and-13 ball last year.  The same Jay Lane of poker fame is heading up the team this year after Coach Johnny Kitson has stepped aside to go and get married.  Yes, I know it&#8217;s softball, but dammit I do love anything close to baseball.  Also, I&#8217;m not 28 yet, so I can&#8217;t join up with the <a href="http://www.louisvillemsbl.org/" class="External">Louisville Men&#8217;s Senior Baseball League</a> 28 and Over.</p>

	    <p>Some say that the second Internet bubble is upon us.  I think they might just be right, based on the amount and complexity of work that has been coming in to us at work.  This time, however, it&#8217;s considerably more<br />
robust and &#8220;pop-proof&#8221; (or at least we all hope so).  The ideas that inflated the first bubble seem to have<br />
risen from the ashes of that first wave.  The idea of the Internet as Desktop and Desktop as Internet.<br />
The dreamy &#8220;thin client&#8221; that was going to be everywhere, cheaply and clawing its way onto your TV, into your<br />
car and on the front of your refrigerator.  Rockets on your shoes and teleporters and the whole thing, too.</p>
<p>So maybe it&#8217;s apt that I&#8217;m here in Orlando, so close to Kennedy Space Center where, back in the 1960s, we<br />
actually did make the impossible possible without an implosion.  Lives aren&#8217;t on the line in the Internet,<br />
and so such irrational exuberance can lead to such things.  The hype was believed back then, but now the<br />
people behind the scenes are wiser for the experience.  There were so many great, grand ideas in the late<br />
90&#8242;s, but so little consideration and so much money doesn&#8217;t fly in the world of the Internet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, things have settled down on the Internet.  The browser wars have gone from hot to cold, and<br />
the medium that is the Internet is a little more predictable with fewer outliers.  This has allowed companies<br />
like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft (and a thousand smaller joints) to create applications for all people, all<br />
browsers, all platforms that *work* and bring a little of the promise of the grand ideas of the late 90&#8242;s.</p>
<p>Gmail, Google Maps, Flickr, digg.com, etc. all make use of these grand ideas, like /your data on the web/ and<br />
/the web as read/write/ and the web as a moving, usable and up-to-date desktop application.  The technologies<br />
behind these are various and sundry (mostly sundry), but focus primarily on the easy exchange of easily<br />
readable data.  Things like map info, stock information, search results, whatever.  Make that information easily<br />
available and portable and great things happen.</p>
<p>The reason why I am here at php|tek 2006 is specifically for PHP, but a lot of the content so far has centered<br />
around that overarching idea of what I was just musing about.  The &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243;, the &#8220;next generation&#8221;, whatever<br />
you&#8217;d like to call it.  How does PHP fit in there?  How is it changing to fit in?  Knowing just where the<br />
tech on the web is heading is truly the only way to know what is going on in PHP.</p>
<p>PHP is one of the most widely-used, profilic and advanced technologies used on the web.  Rasmus Lerdorf started<br />
PHP back in 1995 and has been instrumental in it&#8217;s development ever since.  He now works for Yahoo!, and seems to<br />
be focused on these emerging Internet technologies.  Suffice it to say, he remains very much a &#8220;blue-collar&#8221; guy<br />
who created and directs the development of a technology that has affected so much of the &#8220;white-collar&#8221; world.</p>
<p>Rasmus&#8217; keynote speech earlier this morning was considerably less &#8220;high-level&#8221; than I had expected.  This is what I have come to expect from the open-source world.  The people who are making the changes and pushing things forward still have their hands dirty in the real world.  However, those people who are truly successful are the odd ones who can do so and still keep a grip on the big picture.  I get the feeling the Rasmus is one of those<br />
people. He, in his hour-long keynote presentation (I wouldn&#8217;t call it a speech), explained by example and in code the pitfalls of the new-school web apps, and how to mitigate those pitfalls.  He also showcased how PHP can simply and easily be integrated into these &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; apps.  An interesting blend of real-world considerations, code and examples that underscored how important is the inter-relation between technologies.</p>
<p>An unusual keynote, for sure.  Part of me was hoping for more of a &#8220;state of PHP&#8221; sort of address, but much like any good programmer, you leave that stuff for the brass, and get down to nitty-gritty with the troops.  I&#8217;m sitting here in shorts, a t-shirt and flip-flops, so what else should I expect?  More later!</p>
<p>You can check out Rasmus&#8217; presentation in it&#8217;s entirety here: <a href="http://talks.php.net/show/tek06" class="External">talks.php.net/show/tek06</a></p>

<p>The promised free WiFi access didn&#8217;t materialize until about 3 PM here after a fandango of new access points and provider snafus.  Probably a good thing, though, as it allowed the small cadre of geeks who showed up to this con a day early to focus on the &#8220;In-Depth Seminars&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fluidmind.org" class="External">Dan</a> and I chose the &#8220;Master OOP in PHP 5&#8243; talk hosted by <a href="http://marcus-boerger.de/" class="External">Marcus Boerger</a>, one of the architects of the PHP 5 object-oriented code.  Marcus, who lives in Germany, offered up a very straightforward, detailed talks spikedwith a wry sense of humor that pops up when you least expect it.  PHP 5 introduces a &#8220;revamp&#8221; (a term Marcus didn&#8217;t care for) of the OO system in PHP, and pushes it more in the direction of what passes for a standard in the OO world.  Better privacy control, extensibility and overall greater functionality.  A very worthwhile talk and very much on the bleeding edge of the PHP world.</p>
<p>The next talk was &#8220;PHP &amp; AJAX: A winning combination&#8221; with <a href="http://coggeshall.org/" class="External">John Coggeshall</a>, a very outspoken and enthusiastic guy who works with <a href="http://www.oreilly.net" class="External">O&#8217;Reilly</a> (the publisher of many a great book on technology) and Zend (the engine behind PHP).  AJAX is one of those buzzwords in the industry right now like &#8220;LAMP&#8221; (<a href="http://linux.org" class="External">Linux</a> <a href="http://www.apache.org" class="External">Apache</a> <a href="http://www.mysql.org" class="External">MySQL</a> <a href="http://www.php.net" class="External">PHP</a>) and &#8220;podcast&#8221;, which aren&#8217;t anything new (see earlier post <a href="../672.html">on podcasting</a>) but now have a name people can talk about.  AJAX is Javascript (the duct tape of the Internet) and XML (sorta) that powers things like <a href="http://maps.google.com" class="External">Google Maps</a> and <a href="http://www.gmail.com" class="External">GMail</a>.  Very whiz-bang stuff that brings the web interface a little closer to being what you might expect on the desktop.  John spoke a lot about what is wrong with AJAX, and suprisingly little about what PHP can offer it.  He didn&#8217;t really tell Dan or I anything we didn&#8217;t know about AJAX, but in a roundabout way inform everyone that AJAX is still very new and fraught with problems.    AJAX apps may seem simple on the web, but behind the scenes there are some very touch problems borne from the challenge of making computers interface with humans a little bit better.  From that and the little PHP content, I gather that even PHP doesn&#8217;t really know what to do with AJAX until it matures a little.</p>
<p><img src="../../content/images/spacemonkey.jpg" class="FloatRight" /></p>
<p>John wrapped up around 3PM, which luckily allowed Dan and I enough time to beat a path eastward to the <a href="http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/" class="External">Kennedy Space Center</a>.  I&#8217;m a sucker for anything involving space, so this was a welcome and awesome side-trip.  Kennedy Space Center sits out on a island off the Florida coast and our rented <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius" class="External">Toyota Prius</a> got us there quickly, quietly and burning little gas.</p>

Excuse the cursing, but I had just recently foreseen and forestalled my own peril.  At that moment, cursing was and is necessary.</p>

Man &#8211; been a busy time as of late with ol&#8217; Ben!   Let&#8217;s get down to business&#8230;
</p>
<p>
First off, I&#8217;ve been embroiled in a huge project here <a href="http://powercreative.com" class="External">at work</a> to launch 6 (count them one two three four five six) websites for a company called <a href="http://www.heatcraftrpd.com" class="External">Heatcraft</a> in less than a month.  It couldn&#8217;t have been possible without the help of <a href="http://4ourthgate.org" class="External">Yukon Charnelius</a> and the venerable <a href="http://www.x13design.com/bipolar" class="External">m@</a>.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, yes, it&#8217;s true:  I have been playing <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com" class="External">World of Warcraft</a>, and yes, it is everything that they say it is.  Deep, engulfing, wide, full of content and as addictive as crack.  Me?  I&#8217;m a 15th-level Dwarven Paladin name of <i>Cramfist</i> on server Akama.
</p>
<p>Nextly, or perhaps thirdly, ol&#8217; <a href="http://www.4ourthgate.org" class="External">Cholly</a> and I have regularly been playing chess.  Currently, the record stands at 5-4-1 with me holding a tenuous lead.  Ideas are underway to create a Web 2.0 site for chess.  We&#8217;ll see if it takes off&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Lastly, on the <a href="../../soaring.html">soaring</a> front&#8230; You may remember that last year I <a href="https://thelocust.org/blog/662">built a sailplane over the winter</a>.  This year is much the same, but improved!  I&#8217;m building a bigger version of the one I did last year with help from a new friendship with <a href="http://www.polecataero.com" class="External">Denny @ Polecat Aeroplane Works</a> (I did his site for him, too).</p>
