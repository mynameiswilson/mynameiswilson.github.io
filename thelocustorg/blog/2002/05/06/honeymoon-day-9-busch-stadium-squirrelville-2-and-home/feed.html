		<description><![CDATA[Ben &amp; Kelly:

Glad that you visited Olney and actually got to see a real white squirrel.  I am not a native of Olney, but have lived here for 16 years. Did you know that they actually have an annual white squirrel count ??
Olney is a nice &quot;Mayberry type&quot; town but they have some wonderful people and and excellent school district.  Plus it was a terrific place to raise a family.

Hope you visit us again soon.]]></description>
