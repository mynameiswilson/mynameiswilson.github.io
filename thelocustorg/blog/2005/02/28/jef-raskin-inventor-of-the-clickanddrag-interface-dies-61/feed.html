		<description><![CDATA[Jeff Raskin was a pioneer in the way we use computers today.  Here&#039;s the wikipedia entry on him for those curious.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin .
A lot of press attributes him as being the father of the Macintosh or the GUI but this is actually not the case.  Raskin did basically start the Mac project at Apple but his vision of it was a vastly diffferent computer than what was released in 1984.  Check out the Canon Cat for what Raskin originally visioned the mac to be.

Despite that, it was Raskin&#039;s decision that saw the mac released with a one button mouse.  His ideas on the way a user should interact with a computer have alwasys been pretty avant garde but really sensible.  That and looking at his list of accolades, he was pretty damned talented.
Rest in peace.]]></description>
