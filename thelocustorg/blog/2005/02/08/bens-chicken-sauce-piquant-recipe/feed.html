		<description><![CDATA[Yeah -- Kelly essentially has a diabetic diet.  She&#039;s got insulin-resistance issues AND she is all about running, so we try to eat low-carb, whole grain sorta stuff.   As much as I detested it at first, it has become second-nature to eat like this.  A good thing, too -- I&#039;ve shed about 25 lbs from my highest weight.  Also, not eating all that sugar gives me a lot more energy.  Tis&#039; amazing, it is.

We made Thai chicken cakes over the weekend -- they turned out &lt;i&gt;ok&lt;/i&gt; but not super-fantastic.   Ground chicken, breadcrumbs, green onion and fresh cilantro with ground coriander.  Something is missing -- I don&#039;t know what just yet.  Need to hi-jack that chef from Thai Smile!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aren&#039;t you just a wealth of knowledge in regards to ethnic cuisine? I &lt;I&gt;love&lt;/I&gt; the flavor of rye bread...I will totally go check out the Swedish giant rye crackers. Whole grain is so much better for you than anything processed...sounds like you are cooking for someone with special dietary restrictions, as am I. My boyfriend keeps strictly kosher so we never mix meat and dairy, or eat any pork or shellfish. (I guess that means I could never cook up my own chit&#039;lins!) This is why Cajun cooking is so off-limits to me--it&#039;s hard to make etouffee without shellfish or butter. That rye you described sounds great for a veggie pizza, though..maybe even for certain dips or appetizers. Oooohh fun--I love an excuse to make a trip to the ethnic food aisle!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the International aisle at Meijer is fantastic and that is the same bottle I bought.  Thin plastic, about quart size for $2.50.  I&#039;ve heard descriptions of making your &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; fish sauce, but I couldn&#039;t imagine the stench!  I&#039;d have to cook up some chitlins in another pot just to cover it :)

Another thing I suggest from the int&#039;l aisle is the Swedish Knackelbrod (sp?) giant rye cracker discs.  Kelly has to eat like a diabetic, and since they are whole rye they are perfect!  They make great ready-made pizza crusts, and they keep forever just in the pantry.  Just toss on some marinara, fresh red bell pepper, mushrooms, cheese, etc and then cook in the oven at 400-450 degrees for about 10 minutes.  The rye makes for an interesting taste with the pizza, and while it does just fine with a red pizza sauce, I think you could do ever better with like a chicken alfredo pizza or something like that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big fan of Thai cooking and I have a &lt;I&gt;huge&lt;/I&gt; bottle of fish sauce in the fridge. It smells and sounds so nasty...but it&#039;s a powerful secret ingredient when used correctly. I&#039;ll be looking forward to that recipe when you post it.

I will have to check out that oregano in the Mexican section. Have you ever been to the ethnic food aisle at Meijer? &lt;I&gt;So&lt;/I&gt; interesting. That&#039;s where my fish sauce came from. I didn&#039;t buy the tiny Americanized brand either--I got the big scary bottle with Asian characters on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I loved about it was that it A) didn&#039;t use any roux, which makes for a lighter dish and B) it used LOTS of herbs.  I love stuff with lots of herbs like thyme and oregano in it.

Normally, I buy the whole oregano you can find in the &quot;Mexican&quot; section of your local grocery.  It&#039;s also cheaper, too.

I made some hellified Thai-style jerky the other day, too -- but I&#039;m not posting that recipe until I get it &quot;just right&quot;.  The secret: fish sauce.

I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it!  Do tell me how it turned out.  I personally was OK with it and it was a big hit at the office, but I was trying for something with a little more &quot;tang&quot; to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well I for one think it sounds delicious and I plan on making it soon. The best part is it&#039;s both Cajun AND kosher (very important when you&#039;re a southern girl cooking for a Jewish boyfriend). Do &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt; let Hunter make fun of you--I&#039;m excited you posted it.]]></description>
