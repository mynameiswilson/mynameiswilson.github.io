		<description><![CDATA[Podcasting - as a lawyer, an American, and a card-carrying member of the ACLU, I love it.   Unfortunately, the First Amendment has no flavor control, so with the technology explosion of the last 10 years, you get the crap with the worthwhile stuff.  Or, to quote an old favorite song of mine - &quot;You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and there your have - The Facts of Life, The Facts of Life.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[If I had any way of contact David that was beyond your reach, I would have informed him of your complaint and put you in contact with him.  Regretably, I have no other means of contact than what you have posted in your prior comment.

This argument is between you and David and is in regards to $43 worth of LEGO toys sold on eBay.  eBay has clear policies on dispute resolution, and none of which involve threatening third parties such as myself with legal action.  I would hope that you continue your search in a civil matter and finally find satisfaction.

Finally, from this point on I will remove any posts by you on this subject from my forum.  Again, you can contact me via email to further this discussion if you so wish.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I refuse to continue this discussion with someone who A) refuses to give at least their valid email address and B) is determined on carrying this conversation in a public (and no to mention off-topic) forum.

Finally, I will tell you that I have not spoken with David in well over a month.  I know not of his whereabouts or current contact information.  The auction agreement is between you and him, and if I could put you in contact with him, I would.  You know how to contact me further if you see fit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was a very clever response.  Unfortunately cleverness isn&#039;t going to help you.

Your friend David Gruneisen (aka stone_axe) recently defrauded several people out of hundreds of dollars in a fake ebay auction scheme (e.g. item #5972575444).  He used your web site to advertise the imaginary items thereby making you a party to the crime.

I suggest you have a talk with your friend.  If you fail to convince him to refund the payments, we may be contacting you to testify against him in exchange for removing you from the complaints.  I suggest you try hard.  Attorney fees for cases like this start at $3000 and the state of Kentucky has dedicated staff specifically for internet fraud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This site is operated by me, Ben Wilson.  I know of &quot;stone_axe&quot;, but this isn&#039;t his site.   Your wife might be a lawyer and you might be a doctor, but you sure aren&#039;t much of a private detective.  Thanks for crapping in the wrong place!]]></description>
