		<description><![CDATA[I remember when my humanities class performed &lt;I&gt;Lysistrata&lt;/I&gt; in high school. We updated it to be a gang war and did the whole thing in gangsta slang. I probably would not remember anything about &lt;I&gt;Lysistrata&lt;/I&gt; had we not made it so fun. Anyway, congrats to you for taking a great photo and to and your subject for being so photogenic!]]></description>

Do you have reason to believe that &quot;Jarrod&quot; was not who he says he is and was using an alias?   Just wondering.  :)]]></description>
