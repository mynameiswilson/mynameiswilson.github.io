		<description><![CDATA[I just got a verizon phone and made the same discovery. Actually want to upload my own art as a wallpaper (background) and can&#039;t get the picture off my  memory card, or by sending to  myself.  It is also blocked and looks like a blank white screen when I try to open a file. Really stinks. I wonder if something like what you describe above exists for an audiovox cdm8940.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know why Verizon would cripple a cool little device like this, but Kelly actually called me &quot;awesome&quot; numerous times yesterday, which is a rare event.

Surprisingly, the St. Crispin&#039;s Day speech makes a decent ring-tone!  At least now, rather than being publically shamed each time my phone rings, I can say &quot;perchance thy ear canst be bent to listen to the finer oratory of Bill Shakespeare&quot;.]]></description>
