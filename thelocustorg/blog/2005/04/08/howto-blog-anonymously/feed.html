		<description><![CDATA[...but I think some people have the wrong impression of the Internet -- it isn&#039;t another planet, and the things you do and say there are not free from scrutiny.  Just be careful!

For example, I wouldn&#039;t suggest you name your website &lt;a href=&quot;http://oneopinionatedbitch.com/&quot;&gt;One Opinionated Bitch&lt;/a&gt; and send that out on resumes.  (Yeah, I&#039;ve seen that resume).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know I shouldn&#039;t blog about work but I can&#039;t help myself. So many things happen there that crack me up. I&#039;m worried that one day my boss will find it and recognize himself....but at the same time I think it&#039;d do him good.

One of my students reads my blog and he&#039;s always surprised to see what  I write about.  It&#039;s a whole different perspective from my end of the podium.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[...to write a &quot;really good post&quot;.  Steady improvement, while laborious, is still improvement :)

All this time spent with copy writers and what-not have forced me to write better, lest I think myself a troll.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was a really good post.  Very meta- blogging about blogging.  Perhaps this comment should comment about comments?  No, wait, we already did that.

Anyway, nicely written.]]></description>
