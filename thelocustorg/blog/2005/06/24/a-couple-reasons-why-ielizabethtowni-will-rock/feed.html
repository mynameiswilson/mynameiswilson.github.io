		<description><![CDATA[The movie says you can drive from E-town to Nashville in 45 minutes???  Yeah, if you are driving like 150mph.  That is like a 1.5-2 hour trip.   Come on, how else would they be able to smush in all the scenic stuff in Louisville if he just hopped in the car and got right on 65?  Now, the one the he WOULD have seen that way is &quot;Gobel&#039;s&quot; - subtitled &quot;Girls Girls Girls.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ll admit it!  zac tiesman, who is from E-town says that it&#039;s actually not possible to drive from E-town to Nashville in 45 minutes, either....

So yeah, he was taking the scenic route.  I guess it&#039;s better than driving past the landfill and the Ditch Witch dealership...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok, so did people see this movie? I just got around to watching it. beyond the fact that I felt like I was watching 3 different movies, I had a hard time concentrating because I was trying to figure out why he was driving by Slugger Field and UofL if he was on his way from the airport to Etown. am I just forgetting my geography?
At least he got schooled on how to pronounce Louisville.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although he sniveled pretty well in Troy and was acceptable in Kingdom of Heaven.  I think this is his first non-period movie.

&quot;Elvish eyes...&quot;  Wow.  I revel in that nerdiness.  You should have seen me at the Chicago Comicon; and those people aren&#039;t even really famous!]]></description>

&quot;Hey &#039;Lando!  I&#039;ve got a paper bag here!  I was wondering if you could get in it.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I want to see if you could act your way out.&quot;
