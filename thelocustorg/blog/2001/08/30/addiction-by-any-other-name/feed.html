		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve told you guys that I was addicted to caffine.  Stopping cold turkey is really hard.  I can drink it occasionally, but if I drink more than 2 caffine-enhanced drinks in one day, I am back on the addiction wagon!  I think we all know Chuck is addicted and couldn&#039;t stop if he tried!  Caffine isn&#039;t the most serious drug, but there is no question it is addictive and has some serious side effects if you try to quit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[though i wouldn&#039;t consider once every 3 days &quot;all the time&quot; (hehe).  though this activity is constructive, i think.  i&#039;m archiving thoughts, things i&#039;m thinking about here and now.  i think that sometime in the far, distant future, i&#039;ll forget about it.  and i don&#039;t want to forget.
&lt;p&gt;
addiction is a hard thing to put your finger on.  though i would assume that if something (action, substance, habit, whatever) interferes with your well-being, mental or physical, you could call that an addiction.]]></description>
