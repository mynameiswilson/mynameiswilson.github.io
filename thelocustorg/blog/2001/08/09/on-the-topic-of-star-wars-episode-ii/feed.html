		<description><![CDATA[I had to force myself to deal with Jar Jar, somewhat subconsiously, just so I could enjoy the &lt;I&gt;Phantom Menace&lt;/I&gt; even with its faults.  The Ewoks, however, have always been a favorite of mine.  Then again I also spend half of my day playing with cats mostly because they&#039;re so cute.  As for the kids thing, I don&#039;t see any reason why a film can&#039;t be made that&#039;s good for both kids and adults.  Kids will understand it on one level.  Adults on another.  I think &lt;I&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ddc.net/ygg/etext/animal.htm&quot;&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/I&gt; (though a book) is the classic example of that sort of thing.  I&#039;m sure its challenging to reach both audiences, but definitely possible.  And I think Lucas is capable of that level of directing.  No matter how many stupid things he says from time to time (which admittedly I hear mostly filtered through Hunter), I&#039;m sure deep down he&#039;s a really bright guy that is capable of a lot more than what he&#039;s doing.  That&#039;s what make the whole thing so bad.  If he were just stupid then I&#039;d say to hell with it.  But as it is, he&#039;s just being a jackass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[... the first trilogy were children&#039;s movies too.  They could be enjoyed by people of all ages, but I think they were definately geared toward (at the very least) the teenage market.  The difference being, they weren&#039;t insulting to that market in the way I feel the pat inclusion of Ewoks and Jar Jar is.  Oh look, they&#039;re cute, kids will like them.  It makes it seem like Lucas is focusing much more on commercialism then art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That, of course, is the most obvious statement of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frankly, I don&#039;t think he has to answer to any fans; I mistrust any artist that lets his audience sway his work to a great degree.  If I felt he were just following his impulses and they differed from that of the audience, then I wouldn&#039;t have a problem.  What Lucas is doing, however, is following his nose to the fat bags of cash money.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is selling out.  TO THE MAN.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I knew somewhere -- perhaps in the back of my mind -- that Hunter would bring up the &quot;childrens movie&quot; point, which i find very valid.  Though, it pains me to see Lucas point his movies in that direction.  (Technically, he can do whatever the hell he wants being HERR DIRECTOR, but we&#039;re all critics).
&lt;p&gt;
So, instead of attempting to make a good, solid, INTELLIGENT movie that isn&#039;t hawked by Mountain Dew and Fisher-fucking-Price, Lucas puts his aim at the kids.  It&#039;s a let down to the throngs of fans that kept the Star Wars junket running for the last 20 years.  They&#039;ve grown older, wiser, perhaps more discerning -- and they are left behind by films like The Phantom Menace, and while I know a title isn&#039;t anything to base expectations on, this new installment.
&lt;p&gt;
When something like this comes out and it is immediately lauded in public, and apparently even in private, there is always a cause.  Misdirection/misperceptions on the part of a person or persons in control.
&lt;p&gt;
So, how could this have happened?  Well, Lucas knows one thing -- and that one this is FAT SACKS OF ROYALTY CASH.  Get these movies into the minds of the young &#039;uns, and he&#039;ll live like a millionaire for the rest of his life.  Oh wait! He already does!  And why, you ask?  Because we loved his first three films.  They were great! They were fun!  Yay Star Wars! I&#039;m not &lt;i&gt;expecting&lt;/i&gt; anything from the man, and he doesn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;owe&lt;/i&gt; we fans a thing.  I take that back, partially.  This latest embarrassment smacks of a lack of respect for the people that stuffed those fat sacks of cash for him! That&#039;s all I want -- respect.
&lt;p&gt;
But, it&#039;s George&#039;s film.  He can do damn well what he pleases with it.  But for me, this is close to the last straw.
&lt;p&gt;
Later George!  Take a tip from someone who actually listens to his audience, and CARES WHAT THEY THINK -- &lt;a href=http://www.viewaskew.com&gt;snoogans!&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
