		<description><![CDATA[Well, after multiple attempts I was able to listen to a Sonic Youth song for eleven seconds.  Which is over a 150% improvement.  As for login wackiness, I&#039;m pretty sure I was using thelocust.org &amp; not www.thelocust.org, but I shall remain ever vigilent in the future.  I continue my support for the idea of thelocust radio, even if it comes in handy eleven-second size bites of rawk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm... i don&#039;t know about the streaming problems.  Kelly, Najati and Geoff didn&#039;t have any problems.  Strange.  I guess I could downgrade the quality -- that would take up less bandwidth.
&lt;p&gt;
As far as the login problems go... that may be a weird cookie issue.  make sure you are going to https://thelocust.org and not www.thelocust.org -- i&#039;ve had problems before with that.]]></description>
