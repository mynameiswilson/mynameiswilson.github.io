		<description><![CDATA[I know a bribe when I see it.  Bush is essentially paying us off so that when the budget cutbacks start to hit, he&#039;ll be able to cite the money he gave us back in the summer.  Shit, he&#039;s practically saying &quot;I&#039;ll give you three hundred bucks to be my friend.&quot;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
So, although I voted for Bush (and I still don&#039;t regret it) I don&#039;t care for much of what he&#039;s done in office.  One of the things I do agree with is the tax cut.  I think this &quot;instant rebate&quot; stuff is demagoguing at its best, but I agree with the rest of it.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I&#039;m not upset about getting a check in the mail, but it&#039;s not going to make it any more likely that I&#039;ll vote for Bush next time around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Giving money back to people is a good idea.  Ignoring all arguments about underfunded programs or about how this cut helps rich people more, the general concept of a tax cut is reasonable.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The budget is balanced.  There is this surplus that they all talk about, so why not give some back?  Sure, the entire surplus wouldn&#039;t cover the cost of social security for our parents, but did you really think it was going to be there for us anyhow?
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I say, if the decision comes down to lower taxes or more government spending, I&#039;ll take the lower taxes any day.  And it certaily appears that those were the only two choices being considered by Congress.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;ll notice, that $300 is a MAXIMUM amount.  What you really get is 5% of your total tax liability for 2000, which for us poor schmucks is actually rather less than $300.  So the truly poor don&#039;t even get beer money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really if you think about it, it doesn&#039;t mesh together real well.  I say at the beginning that the marginal propensity to say in the US is 5%, but then i say that most folks will save the money, thus defeating Bush.  Oh well.  It&#039;s shortsighted any way you look at it.]]></description>
