		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, i mentioned that I took the controls, and the plane DID crash, however, not because of pilot error.  The wing folded at it&#039;s center joint, which it should NEVER do.   So, therefore, it is a design issue on behalf of the kit&#039;s manufacturer, Grupoca.  I have been absolved!  (Oh, and i&#039;ve re-inforced the wing).
&lt;p&gt;
Believe me, after this crashed, we had our alibis laid out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good documentation on the maiden flight, and untimely DOOM of the Flying Shoebox.  Great resolution on those pics, too.  Another person might point out that as soon as you took the controls the plane embarked upon a kamikaze mission.  And yes, that other person would be me.  Snooch to the booch.]]></description>
