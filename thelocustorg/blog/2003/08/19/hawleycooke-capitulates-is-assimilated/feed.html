		<description><![CDATA[You would be correct on all points, yes we were the lowest paid, and yes we are getting raises and yes, more oppportunities for advancement.  Plus, should I actually leave Louisville (gasp!), it would be easier to just switch stores.  :)]]></description>

So, if it had to be (and it did), I&#039;m glad it was Borders.]]></description>
