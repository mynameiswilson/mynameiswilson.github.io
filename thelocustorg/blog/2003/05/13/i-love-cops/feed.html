		<description><![CDATA[if they properly rationed the first few goats they got, and prepared the meat so it wouldn&#039;t go bad, then they could maybe afford to keep a couple of the goats &quot;on hand&quot; for other purposes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
honestly though, i hesitate to think what inmates would do with a live goat. something tells me it wouldn&#039;t be &quot;rides&quot; or &quot;jousting.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think one week they would keep the goat alive so they could ride it around the yard.  (I envision a large prison type yard in the back).  Then perhaps the opposing &quot;tribe&quot; would save a goat next week, and there would be jousting.]]></description>
