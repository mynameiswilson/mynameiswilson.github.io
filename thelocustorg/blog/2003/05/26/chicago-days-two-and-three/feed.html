		<description><![CDATA[...while on the relaying regards tip, Nick  apparently has a local (to us) cell-phone number, in case anyone should like to call him and say &quot;hello&quot; whilst Joey is gone in Colorado for 2.5 months.  The alpine villa where Joey is staying may have a phone, I don&#039;t know.  Intelligence indicates that the town in which he will be performing as Seymour Krelborn in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; has but a single stoplight.  Perhaps even a single horse.  So, yeah, peeps should ring up Nick to see how he&#039;s doing from time to time.]]></description>
