		<description><![CDATA[I thought it was well worth the price tag.  I&#039;m kinda a design junkie, though, so I really dig hardcovers and whatnot.  The imprint under the dust cover is super cool.  I loved the story- you could tell that Ellis was really connected to the material.  And Colleen Doran&#039;s art on this will likely finally give her some well-deserved wider recognition.&lt;p&gt;
Nick, on the other hand, recommends waiting for the trade paperback.  The story didn&#039;t catch him quite as much.  So, I guess it&#039;s still a crap shoot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[have you had a chance to leaf through &quot;Orbiter&quot; yet? i wanted to pick it up, but i&#039;m planning on waiting until they come out with a paperback, rather than the $25 hardcover.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, if it&#039;s really hot, i may go ahead an pick it up. Let me know what ya think of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think that it could work in a very small runs at the moment.  like park and ride stuff from the south and east ends to downtown, but they certainly wouldn&#039;t run round-the-clock or anything.  we don&#039;t have the parking problems, the congestion, or just the people to support it, i don&#039;t think.  i could be wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben forgot to mention that while we were out shopping we went a nice little comic store called, appropriately enough, Chicago Comics.  I picked up Warren Ellis &amp; Colleen Doran&#039;s new graphic novel &quot;Orbiter&quot;, as well as Chip Zdarsky&#039;s &quot;Collected Prison Funnies&quot; and a couple of old zines from the nineties that looked fairly interesting and were also very cheap.  Probably the neatest find was the second issue of Found Magazine.  They have an online presence and if I wasn&#039;t too lazy I would dig up the links for all these things I&#039;m mentioning.  Perhaps later!&lt;p&gt;
  Today: the Cubs at Wrigely!  And quite possibly more public intoxication on the &quot;L&quot;!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, Ben.  It&#039;s good stuff.  However, you&#039;re not entirely correct about it being unfeasible in Lou.  My best friend, Susanne, is one of the engineers working on the project.  She specializes in bridges.  Just a little FYI. I haven&#039;t gotten any updates from her in a while, and it will be a good amount of time from implementation...]]></description>
