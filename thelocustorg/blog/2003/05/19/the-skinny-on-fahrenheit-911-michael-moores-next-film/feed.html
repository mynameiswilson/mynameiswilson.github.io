		<description><![CDATA[...Moore is often characterized as the &quot;radical left&quot;, and people like O&#039;Reilly and Scarborough are characterized as the &quot;radical right&quot;.  They both serve a purpose, I guess.  Moore is railed on because of his factual flaws, thus making his credibility suspect.  O&#039;Reilly and Scarborough often make similar leaps in logic, but are viewed by many to be &quot;more credible&quot; (i think.  maybe it&#039;s the ties).

both sides (Moore / conservative cable news) have differing styles, but both take similar leaps in logic to drive home their points.]]></description>
