		<description><![CDATA[As I see it, his advertising is a bunch of b.s. My coworkers got hit by a Clark county police car on their way home from work.The law firm Issacs and Issacs promised them a settlement of up to 1.5 million if they signed the dotted line.Two weeks later the insurance company offered them an offer of 50 grand if they didn&#039;t sign with any law firm.So far Issacs and Issacs have gotten them about 10 grand in which they still haven&#039;t received. This has been going on since February of 07]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[oh, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m criticizing anyone for helping injured people.  &quot;Neck-brace litigation&quot; refers to the outrageous &quot;turn this wreck into this check&quot; advertising that is his public (ne&#039; TV) persona.  If anything is worth criticizing, it would be that.  It certainly hasn&#039;t helped the already beleaguered image of the injury lawyer in my eyes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Isaacs said he flagged down a police officer to alert him to the possibility that other poles might be unsafe. He said the police called later to see if he was OK.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They called later to see if he was OK?  That sure is nice.  Knowing Isaac&#039;s reputation for neck-brace litigation, I&#039;m sure that&#039;s what they were calling for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;After returning later with a hammer, &#039;&#039;I found that some of the other poles with the same large heavy lighting system, also show signs of deterioration.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Maybe deterioration caused by &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;repeated bashing with a hammer???&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>
