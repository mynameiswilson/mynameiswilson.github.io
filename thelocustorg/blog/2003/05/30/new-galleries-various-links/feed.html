		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got pretty good seats for the 30th show as a b-day present from mi madre.  Chris (my roomie) and the esteemed Mr. Smith of Chitown have both agreed to go with.  (I have a couple of prospects on #4 lined up.)  But, just so you know, he&#039;s also going to be there the following 2 days, so if the 30th is sold out, perhaps the others are not.  It was in Sept. that I saw him last year in London, so maybe I&#039;ll just make Eddie my September thing each year!  :) I wish!]]></description>
