		<description><![CDATA[Showtime has already had some success with a reality drama about the porn industry with &quot;Family Business&quot;.  It&#039;s about Seymore Butts.  It&#039;s actually very entertaining and interesting.  Oh, and the genitals are not blurred so much.  But, they are not the focal point of the show either, so don&#039;t go looking for it hoping to see a lot of porn.  You will see some, but it&#039;s more about his life.  Wow, long post!]]></description>
