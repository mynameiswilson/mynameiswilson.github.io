		<description><![CDATA[...my earlier comment on album-oriented five-o-clock rock.  nothing against loverboy -- they had their day -- but i think my comps need to espouse the rarely heard.  you throw that song, or say, &quot;9 to 5&quot; on there, and it&#039;s like a turd in a punchbowl.  (not to equate loverboy or dolly parton with a turd, or my compilation as a punchbowl, but the point is that it&#039;s just too striking).  my intentions are for the listeners to say &quot;oh wow! who is this?&quot; not &quot;oh shit, it&#039;s that damned Loverboy song... AGAIN&quot;, and then flip off the CD and the FM station turns on playing Huey Lewis and the News&#039; &quot;Workin&#039; for the Weekend&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You ought to throw &quot;EMI&quot; by the Pistols in there just for the hell of it.  And I&#039;m telling you, go with Creedence&#039;s version of &quot;Proud Mary&quot; because it has the rock.  And screw Kevin Spacey&#039;s speech, throw in Edward Norton&#039;s dialogue from Fight Club, right after he beats the shit out of himself in front of his boss.  And you are a wise man to keep Ani Difranco on her own CDs where no one else can be harmed.]]></description>
