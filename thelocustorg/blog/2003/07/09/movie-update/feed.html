		<description><![CDATA[Yoko Kanno is the John Williams analog of Japanese anime soundtracks. She&#039;s done the score and soundtracks for many Japanese anime TV shows and OAVs (original animated videos). For those of you in the US who are interested in hearing more of what she&#039;s done, her big breakthrough - the soundtrack to Macross Plus (volumes 1 and 2) are available in the US domestically. Her latest was the soundtrack to the Ghost in the Shell TV series that debut in Japan last year. I don&#039;t know if its available outside of Japan but I have the soundtrack - which I think is good. Its sounds a lot like the music from Cowboy Bebop - sans the jazz. Granted, that was the most breathtaking thing about Cowboy Bebop - which was incidentally all an homage to Lupan the 3rd.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anime soundtrack music != typical Japanese music.

Interesting note - for those who have seen the Cowboy Bebop series: Originally, the character of Ed was going to be a boy and the character design for that boy was totally different - you can actually see him in a cameo in one of the later episodes. The entire character of Ed came about when the lead designer of the series had lunch with Yoko Kanno. He didn;t know at the time who she was but in an interview said that if you ever met her, she may not look like it so much but she&#039;s basically Ed - or rather Ed is basically her.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s longer than it should be, but it&#039;s a good movie.  Worth it absolutely for Ewan Macgregor&#039;s performance, which forshadowed the romantic leading man status that he&#039;s acheiving these days.  Also notable for a kick-ass sequence set to &quot;Leave&quot; by R.E.M.  The movie may be considered a failure, but it&#039;s a failure with a lot going on in it and a lot to like (like A.I.)]]></description>
