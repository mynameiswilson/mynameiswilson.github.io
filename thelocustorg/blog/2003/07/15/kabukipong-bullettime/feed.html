		<description><![CDATA[Actually, those guys in black are called &quot;benshi&quot;. Benshi are found originally in Kabuki where basically they act as grips or roadies - rearranging shit right in the middle of the play or doing stuff with the actors or changing background screens and other dramatic stuff.

They pop up in anime, tv and other stuff from time to time over here.

Also - at times, Japanese TV is about as twisted as it&#039;s somtimes portrayed on the Simpsons. I once saw a show where an amature stand up comic had to go catch a live octopus and cook it. The octopus was like 4 meters long and nearly drowned the comic after trying to eat him. After spearing it and dragging its carcass ashore, the comic then took a bite out of the raw, still slightly twitching pseudopod.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thats the title of the show. Its of course, from Japan. The Title loosely translated is:
Kin-Chan&#039;s Masquerade Award Show- its a very famous, long-running TV show over here that involves normal people going on the show and performing some kind of scripted stunt they&#039;ve concocted themselves. So yeah, very gong-show like in premise.
The group of performers are 7 30-something salary men (Japanese work-a-holic businessmen). I&#039;ve seen the show many a time over here - this is by far the best stunt I have ever seen on the show.]]></description>
