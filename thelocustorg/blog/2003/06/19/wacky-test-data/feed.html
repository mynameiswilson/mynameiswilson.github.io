		<description><![CDATA[I think the disfigured face was actually client-supplied, no joke.  It had to do with a third-world charity doctors-without-boarders kind of thing.  It was on the front page of that project for too long.  Bad enough that we had to work 60+ hours a week on it (without o.t. hehe) but that FACE...

Well, as I recall some of Tommy&#039;s Twain excepts contained variations on the &quot;N&quot; word and that was just freaking bizare, especially considering the client.  I about lost it, then immediately told him to cut that shiznit right-the-hell out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that was Tommy I think.  Who knew he was a literary fan?

quote:
Those were hot days! Yes! Hot days when it all began! Dinah owned a fixer-upper in the center of town, only two blocks away from my house, only five blocks away from the methadone clinic!

Not necessarily &quot;naughty&quot;, but certainly weird.  The photos he threw in there were certainly odd, too...  Like that one of the woman with the disfigured face?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Remember the guy who quoted Carroll and Twain when coding test data for the United Methodist site?  I&#039;m doing HTML/Javascript for dozens of these pages, mostly about Black Colleges and African ministries and test data from Huck Finn kept popping up (which the client had access to) and I shouldn&#039;t need to remind anyone how un-PC that novel can be by today&#039;s standards, especially taken out of context, ESPECIALLY taken out of context and placed in to THAT context.  To this day I don&#039;t know if he did that on purpose or was just that blind.]]></description>
