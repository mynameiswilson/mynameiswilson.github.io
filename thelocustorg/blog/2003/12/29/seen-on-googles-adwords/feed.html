		<description><![CDATA[language is nothing more than a bunch of mutations of other words/sounds.  However, I think that when trying to put something reputable together, perhaps one would want to err on the side of caution, especially if there is already another, legitimate, word to express what you are trying to say.  But, I&#039;m no purist and don&#039;t see any need to Frenchify the English language.  There are other, more offensive, words that I would like to see extinction themselves into oblivion.  But, I&#039;ll not suffocation myself waiting.  And no, I&#039;m not knocking the French.  Their language, they can stalemate it as much as they want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I even noticed that you said you threw that term into Google, rather than saying you &quot;googled&quot; it, as everyone else seems to say. Bravo!]]></description>
