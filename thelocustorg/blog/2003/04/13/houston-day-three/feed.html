		<description><![CDATA[...i&#039;ll tell you that the skating rink on the Belvedere (which is right close to the Galleria) isn&#039;t open but during the winter. It gets too hot here to maintain such things!  In fact, the Galleria is being torn down now... they&#039;ve torn out the glass and everything...   I&#039;d like to try my hand at curling, but until its winter, I&#039;ll have to settle for office-carpet bocce :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I stayed in the hotel above the Galleria once on a business trip. It was May, and the skating rink was still operational; does it run all year &#039;round or something?

Also, I am Canadian and have been an avid curler for much of my life (I&#039;m not kidding). Yes, the tradition of the winners buying the losers a beer exists, and no, it doesn&#039;t matter what time it is.]]></description>
