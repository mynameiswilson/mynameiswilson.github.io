                        <p>FirstBuild is GE Appliances product innovation lab and makerspace. In 2018 they embarked on a challenge to design and create something previously only available to high-end restaurants and bars: a clear ice machine.</p>
                        <p>In deep collaboration with the FirstBuild team, we planned and executed a strategy-backed crowdfunded product launch that exceeded 300% of their goal.</p>

                        <p>Since it's first publishing in 1935, Mr. Boston Bartender's Guide has been the quintessential guide to cocktails in America.</p>
                        <p>Beginning in 2015, Sazerac partnered with VIA Studio to take this physical reference online, in a compelling and user-friendly way.</p>
                        <p>Over the next couple of years, we designed &amp; built a first-of-its-kind recipe database, digitally transcribing 80 years of cocktail recipes into an API-powered archive, fronted by a unique, user-driven website.</p>
                        <p>In addition, VIA Studio developed a digital brand, identity and user interface for Mr. Boston - a brand that had not yet been digitally experienced.</p>

                            <li><strong>Data Design & Acquisition:</strong> In collaboration with our Lead Developer, I helped to design the data structure and led the work of loading, organizing and cleaning the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Working closely with our UX Designer, I helped translate goals and priorities into the app you see today. In addition, I helped to drive user testing.</li>

                        <h3><strong>GE Energy</strong> // <em>Climb Time</em> Interactive Experience</h3>
                        <p><em>Climb Time</em> is a multiplayer experience developed for GE Energy.</p>
                        <p>Originally codenamed "TopIt", <em>Climb Time</em> was launched at the 2012 Windpower tradeshow in Atlanta, Georgia. The event was held inside an airplane hangar at the Delta headquarters - with a bar under the belly of the 737 resting inside. The <em>Climb Time</em> experience was displayed on two 55" monitors side-by-side and simulcast for the crowd on a 40-foot wide projection screen. The game pitted two contestants in a race to the top of a 90-meter tall wind turbine. Along the way, each contestant had to climb the ladder, open the hatches, complete a maintenance-based mini-game, and eventually reach the top hatch of the turbine where their character danced while they had their photo taken by the Kinect.</p>
                        <p>On every front - design, development and technology - <em>ClimbTime</em> allowed a small, tight team of developers, creatives and 3D designers to flex their muscles and create an experience that was both cutting edge and extremely fun. All in less than 3 months from kickoff to launch!</p>
                        <p>Technologically it was a challenge - but perhaps moreso in the interaction and user-interface design. How do we engage a group of users that likely have never experienced a Kinect-driven game? How will we educate them about the movements required to perform the game?</p>
                        <p>We utilized the Microsoft Kinect controller and it's APIs to drive the interaction to the Unity 3D engine that was crammed full of custom-created models and textures. The head-to-head experience was powered by Unity's internal networking facilities - which also powered the real-time scoreboard and in-game play-versus-player status.</p> 

                        <h4>My roles</h4> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Development:</strong> I acted as lead developer between the two of us for this project. Splitting the work between the "3D world" and the backend, I handled the latter - developing the technology and code to run the game logic, interface with the Microsoft Kinect controller and manage the real-time multiplayer networking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interaction &amp; UX Design:</strong> Between the novel interface technology that is the Microsoft Kinect and the gaming focus of this project, I worked with our creative and development team to design interfaces and interactions that were easily telegraphed, natural and fit the feel of the game. I also helped to develop the "help" prompts throughout the game - striking a balance between too much and too little information for the player.</li>
                            <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> In addition to my roles as a designer and developer on this project, I also kept the project moving - keeping schedules, assigning tasks and coordinating with hardware and services vendors</li>
                        </ul>
